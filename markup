# Advanced deployment options
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment}



When you deploy a node from the console, there are various advanced deployment options available for each node type. The following topic provides more details about each of those options.
{: shortdesc}

**Target audience:** This topic is designed for advanced network operators who are familiar with Hyperledger Fabric and are responsible for creating, monitoring, and managing their components in the blockchain network.

## What types of advanced deployment options are available?
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-options}

The Build a network tutorial is useful for learning how to set up a basic network by using the {{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}}} Platform console. But each use case has its own customizations that are required for a production network. When you are ready to explore additional configuration settings, this topic describes the optional customizations that are available and the considerations they require. The following table describes the types of customizations you can consider for each node type:

|  | Description | CA | Peer | Ordering node | When to perform |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|----|----|
| **Resource allocations** | Customize the allocated resources (CPU, memory, storage) for your node.| ![Check mark icon](../../icons/checkmark-icon.svg) | ![Check mark icon](../../icons/checkmark-icon.svg) | ![Check mark icon](../../icons/checkmark-icon.svg) | CPU and memory can be adjusted during and after deployment. Storage is harder to update after deployment. A best practice is to monitor the storage on your nodes and before they become full, stand up a new larger capacity node to replace the node with exhausted storage. |
| **Hardware Security Module (HSM)** | Configure a node to generate and store the node identity private key in an HSM for increased security. |![Check mark icon](../../icons/checkmark-icon.svg) | ![Check mark icon](../../icons/checkmark-icon.svg) | ![Check mark icon](../../icons/checkmark-icon.svg) | Must be configured when the node is deployed. |
| **Certificate Authority Database and replication** |  Customize the type of database (SqlLite or PostgreSQL) that will be used for storing CA data and configure replication for high availability. |![Check mark icon](../../icons/checkmark-icon.svg) |  |  | Must be configured when the CA is deployed. You cannot switch databases after the CA is deployed. |
| **Peer state database** | Select whether you want the peer to use LevelDB or CouchDB for ledger data. | | ![Check mark icon](../../icons/checkmark-icon.svg) | | All peers on a channel must use the same state database. You cannot change databases after the peer is deployed. |
| **Deployment zone selection** |  When your Kubernetes cluster is configured across multiple zones, you can choose the zone where you want the node to be deployed. | ![Check mark icon](../../icons/checkmark-icon.svg) | ![Check mark icon](../../icons/checkmark-icon.svg)  | ![Check mark icon](../../icons/checkmark-icon.svg) | Must be configured when the node is deployed.

## Before you begin
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-before}

**Before** attempting to deploy a node, it is the network operator's responsibility to monitor the cluster CPU, memory, and storage usage, and ensure that adequate resources are available in the cluster for the node.
{: important}

### Allocating resources
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-allocate-resources}

Because your instance of the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform console and your Kubernetes cluster do not communicate directly about the resources that are available, the process for deploying components by using the console must follow this pattern:

1. **Size the deployment that you want to make**. The **Resource allocation** panels for the CA, peer, and ordering node in the console offer default CPU, memory, and storage allocations for each node. You may need to adjust these values according to your use case. If you are unsure, start with default allocations and adjust them as you understand your needs. Similarly, the **Resource reallocation** panel displays the existing resource allocations. For a sense of how much storage and compute you will need in your cluster, refer to the chart after step 3 that contains the current defaults for the peer, orderer, and CA:
2. **Check whether you have enough resources in your Kubernetes cluster**. If you are using a Kubernetes cluster that is hosted in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, we recommend using the [{{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-monitoring) tool in combination with your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Kubernetes dashboard. If you do not have enough space in your cluster to deploy or resize resources, you need to increase the size of your cluster. For more information about how to increase the size of a cluster, see scaling [Kubernetes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-ca#ca){: external} or [OpenShift](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-ca){: external} clusters. If you have enough space in your cluster, you can continue with step 3.
3. **Use the console to deploy or resize your node**. If your Kubernetes pod is large enough to accommodate the new size of the node, the reallocation should proceed smoothly. If the worker node that the pod is running on is running out of resources, you can add a new larger worker node to your cluster and then delete the existing working node.

| **Component** (all containers) | CPU**  | Memory (GB) | Storage (GB) |
|--------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| **Peer (Hyperledger Fabric v1.4)**                       | 1.1           | 2.8                   | 200 (includes 100GB for peer and 100GB for state database)|
| **Peer (Hyperledger Fabric v2.x)**                       | 0.7           | 2.0                   | 200 (includes 100GB for peer and 100GB for state database)|
| **CA**                         | 0.1           | 0.2                   | 20                     |
| **Ordering node**              | 0.35          | 0.7                   | 100                    |
| **Operator**                   | 0.1           | 0.2                   | 0                      |
| **Console**                    | 1.2           | 2.4                   | 10                     |
{: caption="Table 2. Default resources for nodes on {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform" caption-side="bottom"}
** Actual VPC allocations are visible in the blockchain console when a node is deployed.

Note that when smart contracts are installed on peers that run a Fabric v2.x image, the smart contract is launched in its own pod instead of a separate container on the peer, which accounts for the smaller amount of resources required on the peer.

While users of a free cluster **must use default sizes** for the containers associated with their nodes, users of paid clusters can set these values while the node is being created by clicking the **Resource allocation** box during the creation of their nodes. If this box is not checked, the default resource allocations, which can be seen below, will be used.

For cases when a user wants to minimize charges without stopping or deleting a node, it is possible to scale the node down to a minimum of 0.001 CPU (1 milliCPU). Note that the node will not be functional when using this amount of CPU.

While the figures in this topic endeavor to be precise, be aware that there are times when a node may not deploy even when it appears that you have enough space in your cluster. Make sure to reference your Kubernetes dashboard to see when components deploy and for error messages when they don't. In cases where a component doesn't deploy for a lack of resources, even if there seems to be enough space in the cluster, you will likely have to deploy additional cluster resources for the component to deploy.
{: tip}

The **Resource allocation** panel in the console provides default values for the various fields that are involved in creating a node. These values are chosen because they represent a good way to get started. However, every use case is different. While this topic provides guidance for ways to think about these values, it ultimately falls to the user to monitor their nodes and find sizings that work for them. Therefore, barring situations in which users are certain that they need values different from the defaults, a practical strategy is to use these defaults at first and adjust them later. For an overview of performance and scale of Hyperledger Fabric, which the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform is based on, see [Answering your questions on Hyperledger Fabric performance and scale](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2019/01/answering-your-questions-on-hyperledger-fabric-performance-and-scale/){: external}.

After you have deployed the node, you need to **monitor the resource consumption of the node**. Configure a monitoring tool such as [{{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-monitoring) to observe the nodes and ensure that adequate resources are available to the node containers when processing transactions.
{: important}

All of the containers that are associated with a node have **CPU** and **memory**, while certain containers that are associated with the peer, ordering node, and CA also have **storage**. For more information about storage, see [Persistent storage considerations](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-v2-deploy-iks#ibp-console-storage). Note that when your Kubernetes cluster is configured to use any of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} storage classes, the smallest storage amount that can be allocated to a node is 20Gi.

You are responsible for monitoring your CPU, memory, and storage consumption in your cluster. If you do happen to request more resources for a blockchain node than are available, the node will not start. However, existing nodes will not be affected. If you are using {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} as your cloud provider, CPU and memory can be changed by using the console and Kubernetes cluster on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} dashboard. To expand available storage capacity, refer to the follow links for more information:
- [IBM file storage](/docs/FileStorage?topic=FileStorage-expandCapacity)
- [Portworx](https://docs.portworx.com/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/storage-operations/create-pvcs/resize-pvc/)
- [Block storage](/docs/BlockStorage?topic=BlockStorage-expandingcapacity#expandingcapacity)
{: note}

Every node has a gRPC web proxy container that bootstraps the communication layer between the console and a node. This container has fixed resource values and is included on the Resource allocation panel to provide an accurate estimate of how much space is required on your Kubernetes cluster in order for the node to deploy. Because the values for this container cannot be changed, we will not discuss the gRPC web proxy in the following sections.

## CA deployment
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-CA}

When you deploy a CA, the following advanced deployment options are available:
* [Database and replica sets](#ibp-console-adv-deployment-CA-replica-sets) - Configure a CA for zero downtime.
* [Deployment zone selection](#ibp-console-adv-deployment-ca-k8s-zone) - In a multi-zone cluster, select the zone where the node is deployed.
* [Resource allocation](#ibp-console-adv-deployment-CA-sizing-creation) - Configure the CPU, memory, and storage for the node.
* [Hardware Security Module](#ibp-console-adv-deployment-cfg-hsm) - Configure the CA to use an HSM to generate and store private keys.
* [CA configuration override](#ibp-console-adv-deployment-ca-customization) - Choose this option when you want to override CA configuration settings.

### Database and replica sets
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-CA-replica-sets}

Because redundancy is the key to ensuring that when a node goes down another node is able to continue to process requests, you have the option to configure replica sets for CA nodes. For a complete understanding of what replica sets are and how they can be configured for a CA, see this topic on [Building a high availability Certificate Authority (CA)](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-build-ha-ca).

### Deployment zone selection
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-ca-k8s-zone}

If your Kubernetes cluster is configured across multiple zones, when you deploy a CA you have the option of selecting which zone the CA is deployed to. Check the Advanced deployment option that is labeled **Deployment zone selection** to see the list of zones that is currently configured for your Kubernetes cluster.

### Sizing a CA during creation
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-CA-sizing-creation}

Unlike peers and ordering nodes, which are actively involved in the transaction process, CAs are involved only in the registration and enrollment of identities, and in the creation of an MSP. This means that they require less CPU and memory. To stress a CA, a user would need to overwhelm it with requests (likely using APIs and a script), or have issued so many certificates that the CA runs out of storage. Under typical operations, neither of these things should happen, though as always, these values should reflect the needs of a particular use case.

The CA has only one associated container that we can adjust:

* **CA container**: Encapsulates the internal CA processes, such as registering and enrolling nodes and users, as well as storing a copy of every certificate it issues.

As we noted in our section on [Considerations before you deploy a node](#ibp-console-adv-deployment-before), it is recommended to use the defaults for the CA container and adjust them later when it becomes apparent how they are being utilized by your use case.

| Resources | Condition to increase |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
| **CA container CPU and memory** | When you expect that your CA will be bombarded with registrations and enrollments. |
| **CA storage** | When you plan to use this CA to register a large number of users and applications. |

For more details on the resource allocation panel in the console see [Allocating resource](#ibp-console-adv-deployment-allocate-resources).


#### Creating highly available CAs
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-CA-HA}

For information about creating highly available CAs through the use of replica sets, see [how to configure CA replica sets](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-ha-ca).

### Customizing a CA configuration
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-ca-customization}

In addition to the CA settings that are provided in the console when you provision a CA, you have the option to override some of the settings. If you are familiar with the Hyperledger Fabric CA server, these settings are configured in the [`fabric-ca-server-config.yaml`](https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/serverconfig.html) file when a CA is deployed. The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform console configures these fields for you with default settings. Therefore, many of these fields are not exposed by the console. But the console also includes a panel where you can edit a `JSON` to override a set of these parameters before a CA is deployed.

The ability to override the CA configuration by using the console or APIs is available only in paid clusters.
{: note} 

#### Why would I want to override a CA configuration?
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-ca-customization-why}

You can use the console to configure resource allocation, HSM, or the CA database and then edit the generated `JSON` adding additional parameters and fields for your use case.  For example, you might want to register additional users with the CA when the CA is created, or specify custom affiliations for your organizations. You can also customize the CSR names that are used when certificates are issued by the CA or add affiliations. These are just a few suggestions of customizations you might want to make but the full list of parameters is provided below. This list contains all of fields that can be overridden by editing the `JSON` when a CA is deployed. For more information about what each field is used for you can refer to the [Fabric CA documentation](https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/serverconfig.html){: external}.

#### Providing your own customizations when you create a CA
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-ca-create-json}

After you click **Create a CA** on the nodes tab and step through the CA configuration panels, you can click **Edit configuration** on the Summary panel to view and edit the `JSON`. Note that if you do not select any advanced options in the console, then those advanced configuration settings are not included in the `JSON`, but you can insert them yourself, using the elements provided in `JSON` above.

Alternatively, if you do check any of the advanced options when you configure the CA, those settings are included in the `JSON` on the Summary panel and can be additionally customized.

Any edits that you make to the `JSON` override what was specified in the console UI. For example, if you specified a `Maximum enrollments` value of `10` in the console, but then provided the `maxenrollments` value of `-1` in the `JSON`, then the value in the`JSON` file is used when the CA is deployed. It is the settings that are visible in the `JSON` on the **Summary page** that are used when the CA is deployed.

Here is an example of the minimum required `JSON` parameters for any override when a CA is deployed.

```json

You can insert additional fields or modify the `JSON` that is visible in the **Configuration JSON** box. For example, if you want to deploy a CA and override only the `csr names` values, you can edit the values in the `JSON`. But if you wanted to change the value of the `passwordattempts` field you would insert it into the `JSON` as follows:

```json
{
    "ca": {
        "csr": {
        "cn": "<COMMONNAME>",
        "keyrequest": {

            "ST": "North Carolina",
            "L": "Location",
            "O": "Hyperledger",
            "OU": "Fabric"
          }
        ],

This snippet is provided only as an example of what the modified `JSON` would resemble. **Do not copy and edit this snippet**, as it does not contain the custom values for your configuration. Rather, edit the `JSON` from your console **Configuration JSON** box because it includes the settings for your node.

#### Considerations when including certificates
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-ca-certificates}

Unlike in the Fabric CA configuration file, where specification of a `certfile` includes a file path and certificate name, in this case you need to base64 encode the certificate file (or a concatenated chain of certificates) and then paste the resulting string into the CA `JSON` override. To convert a certificate file into base64 format, run the following command:

```
export FLAG=$(if [ "$(uname -s)" == "Linux" ]; then echo "-w 0"; else echo "-b 0"; fi)
cat <CERT_FILE> | base64 $FLAG
```
{: codeblock}

- Replace `<CERT_FILE>` with the name of the file that you need to encode.

Paste the resulting string into the CA `JSON` override.

#### Modifying CA settings after deployment
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-ca-modify-json}

After a CA is deployed, a subset of the fields can be updated as well. Click the CA tile in the console and then the **Settings** icon to open a side panel. Click **Edit configuration JSON (Advanced)** to override the CA settings. The `JSON` in the **Current configuration** box contains the current settings for the CA. **Not all of these values can be overridden.**

Only the following fields can be updated:

```json
{
    "ca":{
        "cors": {
            "enabled": false,
            "origins": [
                "*"

        },
        "db": {

                    "OU": "Fabric"
                }
            ],
            "hosts": [
                "<<<MYHOST>>>",
                "localhost"
            ],
            "ca": {

            }
        },
        "idemix": {

        },
        "bccsp": {
            "default": "SW",
            "sw": {
                "hash": "SHA2",
                "security": 256,
                "filekeystore": null
            }
        },
        "cfg": {
            "identities": {
                "passwordattempts": 10,
                "allowremove": true
            }
        },
        "metrics": {
            "provider": "prometheus",

                "prefix": "server"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
{: codeblock}

Paste the modified `JSON` that contains only the parameters that you want to update into the **Configuration JSON** box. For example, if you only needed to update the value for the `passwordattempts` field you would paste in this `JSON`:

```json
{
    "ca": {
        "cfg": {
            "identities": {
                "passwordattempts": 3
            }
        }
    }
}
```
{: codeblock}

If you need to enable deletion of registered users from a CA you would insert `"allowremove": true` into the `JSON` as follows:

```json
{
    "ca": {
        "cfg": {
    "identities": {
        "passwordattempts": 10,
        "allowremove": true
        }
    }
    }
}
```
{: codeblock}

The ability to update a CA configuration is not available for CAs that have been imported into the console.
{: note}

## Peer deployment
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-peer}

When you deploy a peer, the following advanced deployment options are available:
* [State database](#ibp-console-adv-deployment-level-couch) - Choose the database for your peers where ledger transactions are stored.
* [Deployment zone selection](#ibp-console-adv-deployment-peer-k8s-zone) - In a multi-zone cluster, select the zone where the node is deployed.
* [External Certificate Authority configuration](#ibp-console-adv-deployment-third-party-ca) - Use certificates from a third-party CA.
* [Resource allocation](#ibp-console-adv-deployment-peers-sizing-creation) - Configure the CPU, memory, and storage for the node.
* [Hardware Security Module](#ibp-console-adv-deployment-cfg-hsm) - Configure the peer to use an HSM to generate and store private keys.
* [Peer configuration override](#ibp-console-adv-deployment-peer-create-json) - Choose this option when you want to override peer configuration.

You also have the ability to choose the version of Fabric that will be used to deploy your peer. It is recommended to always choose the latest version, as this version will have the latest fixes and improvements. However, note that you might have to re-vendor your smart contract if it was written in Golang. For more information, see [Write and package your smart contract](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-smart-contracts-v2#ibp-console-smart-contracts-v2-pkg).
{: important}

### State database
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-level-couch}

During the creation of a peer, it is possible to choose between two state database options: **LevelDB** and **CouchDB**. Recall that the state database keeps the latest value of all of the keys (assets) stored on the blockchain. For example, if a car has been owned by Varad and then Joe, the value of the key that represents the ownership of the car would be "Joe".

Because it can be useful to perform rich queries against the state database (for example, searching for every red car with an automatic transmission that is owned by Joe), users will often choose a Couch database, which stores data as `JSON` objects. LevelDB, on the other hand, only stores information as key-value pairs, and therefore cannot be queried in this way. Users must keep track of block numbers and query the blocks directly (or within a range of block numbers), and parse the information. However, LevelDB is also faster than CouchDB, though it does not support database indexing (which helps performance).

This support for rich queries is why **CouchDB is the default database** unless a user selects the **State database selection** box during the process of adding a peer selects **LevelDB** on the subsequent tab.

Because the data is modeled differently in a Couch database than in a Level database, **the peers in a channel must all use the same database type**. If data written for a Level database is rejected by a Couch database (which can happen, as CouchDB keys have certain formatting restrictions as compared to LevelDB keys), a state fork would be created between the two ledgers. Therefore, **take extreme care when joining a channel to know the database type supported by the channel**. It might be necessary to create a new peer that uses the appropriate database type and join it to the channel. Note that the database type cannot be changed after a peer has been deployed.
{: important}

### Deployment zone selection
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-peer-k8s-zone}

If your Kubernetes cluster is configured across multiple zones, when you deploy a peer you have the option of selecting which zone the peer is deployed to. Check the Advanced deployment option that is labeled **Deployment zone selection** to see the list of zones that is currently configured for your Kubernetes cluster.

If you are deploying a redundant node (that is, another peer when you already have one), it is a best practice to deploy this node into a different zone. You can determine the zone that the other node was deployed to by opening the tile of the node and looking under the Node location. Alternatively, you can use the APIs to deploy a peer or orderer to a specific zone. For more information on how to do this with the APIs, see [Creating a node within a specific zone](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-v2-apis#ibp-v2-apis-zone).

If **multizone-capable storage** is configured for your Kubernetes cluster, when a zone failure occurs, the nodes can come up in another zone with their associated storage intact, ensuring high availability of the node. In order to leverage this capability with the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform, you need to configure your cluster to use **SDS (Portworx)** storage. And when you deploy a peer, select the advanced deployment option labeled **Deployment zone selection** and then select **Across all zones**. To learn more about multizone-capable storage, see the Comparison of persistent storage options for multizone clusters on [OpenShift](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-storage_planning#persistent_storage_overview) or [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Kubernetes service](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage_planning#persistent_storage_overview).

### Sizing a peer during creation
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-peers-sizing-creation}

The peer pod has four containers that can be adjusted:

- **Peer container**: Encapsulates the internal peer processes (such as validating transactions) and the blockchain (in other words, the transaction history) for all of the channels it belongs to. Note that the storage of the peer also includes the smart contracts that are installed on the peer.
- **CouchDB container**: Where the state databases of the peer are stored. Recall that each channel has a distinct state database.
- **Smart contract container**: Recall that during a transaction, the relevant smart contract is "invoked" (in other words, run). Note that all smart contracts that you install on the peer will run in a separate container inside your peer pod, which is known as a Docker-in-Docker container.
- **Smart contract launcher container**: Used to launch a separate pod for each smart contract, eliminating the need for a Docker-in-Docker container in the peer pod. Note that the smart contract launcher container is not where smart contracts actually run, and is therefore given a smaller default resource than the "smart contracts" container that used to be deployed along with a peer. It only exists to help create the pods where smart contracts run. You must make your own allowances in your deployment for the containers for smart contracts, as the pods spun up by the smart contract launcher are not bound by strict resource limitations. The pod will use as many resources as it needs depending on the size of a smart contract and the processing load it encounters. For more information, see [Resource Quotas](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/){: external}.

Note that a separate pod will be created for each smart contract that is installed on each peer, even if you have multiple peers on the same channel that have all installed the same smart contract. So if you have three peers on a channel, and install a smart contract on each one, you will have three smart contract pods running. However, if these three peers are on more than one channel using the **exact same** smart contract, you will still only have three pods running. These smart contract pods will not be deleted if you delete the peer. You must delete them **separately**.
{: important}

The peer also includes a gRPC web proxy container, you cannot adjust the compute for this container.

As we noted in our section on [Considerations before you deploy a node](#ibp-console-adv-deployment-before), it is recommended to use the defaults for these peer containers and adjust them later when it becomes apparent how they are being utilized by your use case.

| Resources | Condition to increase |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
| **Peer container CPU and memory** | When you anticipate a high transaction throughput right away. |
| **Peer storage** | When you anticipate installing many smart contracts on this peer and to join it to many channels. Recall that this storage will also be used to store smart contracts from all channels the peer is joined to. Keep in mind that we estimate a "small" transaction to be in the range of 10,000 bytes (10k). As the default storage is 100G, this means that as many as 10 million total transactions will fit in peer storage before it will need to be expanded (as a practical matter, the maximum number will be less than this, as transactions can vary in size and the number does not include smart contracts). While 100G might therefore seem like much more storage than is needed, keep in mind that storage is relatively inexpensive, and that the process for increasing it is more difficult (require command line) than increasing CPU or memory. |
| **CouchDB container CPU and memory** | When you anticipate a high volume of queries against a large state database. This effect can be mitigated somewhat by using [indexes](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/couchdb_as_state_database.html#couchdb-indexes){: external}. Nevertheless, high volumes might strain CouchDB, which can lead to query and transaction timeouts. |
| **CouchDB (ledger data) storage** | When you expect high throughput on many channels and don't plan to use indexes. However, like the peer storage, the default CouchDB storage is 100G, which is significant. |
| **Smart contract container CPU and memory** | When you expect a high throughput on a channel, especially in cases where multiple smart contracts will be invoked at the same time. You should also increase the resource allocation of your peers if your smart contracts are written in JavaScript or TypeScript.|
| **Smart contract launcher container CPU and memory** | Because the smart contract launcher container streams logs from smart contracts back to a peer, the more smart contracts are running the greater the load on the smart contract launcher. |

The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform supports smart contracts that are written in JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and Go. When you are allocating resources to your peer node, it is important to note that JavaScript and TypeScript smart contracts require more resources than contracts written in Go. The default storage allocation for the peer container is sufficient for most smart contracts. However, when you instantiate a smart contract, you should actively monitor the resources consumed by the pod that contains the smart contract in your cluster by using a tool like [{{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-monitoring) to ensure that adequate resources are available.
{: important}

For more details on the resource allocation panel in the console see [Allocating resource](#ibp-console-adv-deployment-allocate-resources).

### Customizing a peer configuration
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-peer-create-json}

In addition to the peer settings that are provided in the console when you provision a peer, you have the extra option to override some of the peer settings. If you are familiar with Hyperledger Fabric, these settings are configured in the peer configuration `core.yaml` file when a peer is deployed. The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform console configures these fields for you using default settings and many of these fields are not exposed by the console. But the console also includes a panel where you can provide a `JSON` to override a set of these parameters before a peer is deployed. You can find the peer configuration `JSON` and an example of how to use the configuration override to customize your deployment in the sections below.

The ability to override the peer configuration by using the console or APIs is available only in paid clusters.
{: note} 

#### Why would I want to override a peer configuration?
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-peer-customization-why}

A common use case is to override some of the default timeouts, or peer private data settings. You can also customize the gossip configuration. The full list of available overrides is provided below, which contains all fields that can be overridden by editing the `JSON` when a peer is deployed from the console. For more information on each field, refer to the [Fabric sample peer configuration file](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-2.4/sampleconfig/core.yaml){: external} options.

#### Providing your own customizations when you create a peer
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-peer-create-json-own}

After you click **Create a peer** on the nodes tab and step through the peer configuration panels, you can click **Edit configuration** on the Summary panel to view and edit the `JSON`. Note that if you do not select any advanced options in the console, then the generated `JSON` is empty, but you can still insert your own customizations.

Alternatively, if you do check any of the advanced options when you configure the peer, those settings are included in the `JSON` on the Summary panel and can be additionally customized with other fields as needed. Any edits that you make will override what was specified in the console. For example, if you selected to use a LevelDB as the state database, but then overrode the setting to use CouchDB as the state database in the `JSON`, then the CouchDB database settings would be used when the peer is deployed. The override settings that are visible in the `JSON` on the **Summary page** are what is used when the peer is deployed.

You don't need to include the entire set of available parameters in the `JSON`, only the advanced deployment options that you selected in the console along with the parameters that you want to override. For example, if you want to deploy a peer and override the `chaincode startup timeout` and specify a different port for the `statsd address`, you would paste in the following `JSON`:

```json
{
    "peer": {
        "chaincode": {
        "startuptimeout": "600s"
    }
    },
    "metrics": {
        "statsd": {
        "address": "127.0.0.1:9443"
    }
    }
}
```
{: codeblock}

#### Modifying peer settings after deployment
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-peer-modify-json}

After a peer is deployed, a subset of the fields can be updated as well. Click the peer tile in the console and then the **Settings** icon to open a side panel. Click **Edit configuration JSON (Advanced)** to open the panel where you can override the peer settings. The `JSON` in the **Current configuration** box contains the current settings for the peer. **Not all of these values can be overridden after the peer is deployed.**  A subset of these parameters can be overridden by pasting a `JSON` with the overrides into the **Configuration JSON** box. Again, you don't need to include the entire set of parameters from the **Current configuration** `JSON`, only paste the parameters you want to override into the **Configuration JSON** box.

The following subset of parameters can be overridden after a peer is deployed:

```json
{
    "peer": {
        "id": "jdoe",

Paste the modified `JSON` that contains only the parameters that you want to update into the **Configuration JSON** box. For example, if you only need to update the value for the `executetimeout` field you would paste this `JSON` into the **Configuration JSON** box:

{
    "chaincode": {
        "executetimeout": "30s"
    }
}
```

The ability to update override settings for a peer configuration is not available for peers that have been imported into the console.

## Ordering node deployment
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-on}

When you deploy an ordering node, the following advanced deployment options are available:
* [Number of ordering nodes](#ibp-console-adv-deployment-suggested-ordering-node-configurations) - Decide how many ordering nodes are needed.
* [Deployment zone selection
](#ibp-console-adv-deployment-on-k8s-zone) - In a multi-zone cluster, select the zone where the node is deployed.
* [External Certificate Authority configuration](#ibp-console-adv-deployment-third-party-ca) - Use certificates from a third-party CA.
* [Resource allocation](#ibp-console-adv-deployment-orderer-sizing-creation) - Configure the CPU, memory, and storage for the node.
* [Hardware Security Module](#ibp-console-adv-deployment-cfg-hsm) - Configure the ordering node to use an HSM to generate and store private keys.
* [Orderer configuration override](#ibp-console-adv-deployment-orderer-create-json) - Choose this option when you want to override ordering node configuration.

You also have the ability to choose the version of Fabric that will be used to deploy your ordering nodes. It is recommended to always choose the latest version, as this version will have the latest fixes and improvements. Note that it is currently not possible to enable any v2.0 [Fabric capabilities](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.0/capabilities_concept.html){: external}.
{: important}

### Number of ordering nodes
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-suggested-ordering-node-configurations}

In Raft, a **majority of the total number of nodes** must be available for the ordering service to function (this is known as achieving a "quorum" of nodes). In other words, if you have one node, you need that node available to have a quorum, because the majority of one is one. While satisfying the quorum makes sure that the ordering service is functioning, production networks also have to think about deployment configurations that are highly available (in other words, configurations in which the loss of a certain number of nodes can be tolerated by the system). Typically, this means tolerating the loss of two nodes: one node going down during a normal maintenance cycle, and another going down for any other reason (such as a power outage or error).

This is why, by default, the console offers two options: one node or five nodes. Recall that the majority of five is three. This means that in a five node configuration, the loss of two nodes can be tolerated. Users who know that they will be deploying a production solution should therefore choose the five node option.

However many nodes a user chooses to deploy, they have the ability to add more nodes to their ordering service. For more information, see [Adding and removing ordering service nodes](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-add-remove-orderer).

### Deployment zone selection
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-on-k8s-zone}

If your Kubernetes cluster is configured across multiple zones, when you deploy an ordering node you have the option of selecting which zone the node is deployed to. Check the Advanced deployment option that is labeled **Deployment zone selection** to see the list of zones that is currently configured for your Kubernetes cluster.

For a five node ordering service, these nodes will be distributed into multiple zones by default, depending on the relative space available in each zone. You also have the ability to distribute a five node ordering service yourself by clearing the default option to have the zones that are chosen for you and distributing these nodes into the zones you have available. You can check which zone a node was deployed to by opening the tile of the node and looking under the Node location. Alternatively, you can use the APIs to deploy an ordering node to a specific zone. For more information on how to do this with the APIs, see [Creating a node within a specific zone](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-v2-apis#ibp-v2-apis-zone).

If **multizone-capable storage** is configured for your Kubernetes cluster when a zone failure occurs, the nodes can come up in another zone, with their associated storage intact, ensuring high availability of the node. In order to leverage this capability with the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform, you need to configure your cluster to use **SDS (Portworx)** storage. And when you deploy an ordering service or an ordering node, select the advanced deployment option labeled **Deployment zone selection** and then select **Across all zones**. To learn more about multizone-capable storage, see the Comparison of persistent storage options for multizone clusters on  [OpenShift](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-storage_planning#persistent_storage_overview) or [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Kubernetes service](/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage_planning#persistent_storage_overview).

### Sizing an ordering node during creation
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-orderer-sizing-creation}

Because ordering nodes do not maintain a copy of the state DB, they require fewer containers than peers do. However, they do host the blockchain (the transaction history) because the blockchain is where the channel configuration is stored, and the ordering service must know the latest channel configuration to perform its role.

Similar to the CA, an ordering node has only one associated container that we can adjust (if you are deploying a five-node ordering service, you will have five separate ordering node containers, as well as five separate gRPC containers):

* **Ordering node container**: Encapsulates the internal orderer processes (such as validating transactions) and the blockchain for all of the channels it hosts.

As we noted in our section on [Considerations before you deploy a node](#ibp-console-adv-deployment-before), it is recommended to use the defaults for the ordering node container and adjust them later as it becomes apparent how they are being utilized.

| Resources | Condition to increase |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
| **Ordering node container CPU and memory** | When you anticipate a high transaction throughput right away. |
| **Ordering node storage** | When you anticipate that this ordering node will be part of an ordering service on many channels. Recall that the ordering service keeps a copy of the blockchain for every channel they host. The default storage of an ordering node is 100G, same as the container for the peer itself. |

If you plan to deploy a five node Raft ordering service, note that the total of your deployment will increase by a factor of five, a total of 1.75 CPU, 3.5 GB of memory, and 500 GB of storage for the five Raft nodes. A 4 CPU Kubernetes single worker node cluster is the minimum recommended to allow enough CPU for the ordering service cluster and any other nodes you deploy.

If an ordering service is overstressed, it might hit timeouts and start dropping transactions, requiring transactions to be resubmitted. This causes much greater harm to a network than a single peer struggling to keep up. In a Raft ordering service configuration, an overstressed leader node might stop sending heartbeat messages, triggering a leader election, and a temporary cessation of transaction ordering. Likewise, a follower node might miss messages and attempt to trigger a leader election where none is needed.

For more details on the resource allocation panel in the console see [Allocating resource](#ibp-console-adv-deployment-allocate-resources).

### Customizing an ordering service configuration
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-orderer-create-json}

In addition to the ordering node settings that are provided in the console when you provision an ordering node, you have the option to override some of the default settings. If you are familiar with Hyperledger Fabric, these settings are configured in the `orderer.yaml` file when an ordering node is deployed. The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform console configures these fields for you using default settings so many of these fields are not exposed by the console. You can find the orderer configuration `JSON` and an example of how to use the configuration override to customize your deployment in the sections below.

The ability to override the ordering service configuration by using the console or APIs is available only in paid clusters.
{: note} 

#### Why would I want to override an ordering service configuration?
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-orderer-customization-why}

The need to customize the ordering node configuration is less common than the peer or CA. A common use case could be to override default timeouts or the default HSM settings. This list contains all of fields that can be overridden by editing the `JSON` when an ordering node is deployed from the console. For more information about what each field is used for you can refer to the [Fabric sample orderer configuration file](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-2.2/sampleconfig/orderer.yaml){: external} options.

#### Providing your own customizations when you create an ordering service
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-orderer-create-json-custom}

After you click **Add ordering service** on the nodes tab and step through the ordering service configuration panels, you can click **Edit configuration JSON** on the Summary panel to view and edit the `JSON`. Note that if you do not select any advanced options in the console, then the generated `JSON` is empty, but you can insert your own customizations.

Alternatively, if you do check any of the advanced options when you configure the ordering service, those settings are included in the `JSON` on the Summary panel. Any edits that you make to the`JSON` override what was specified in the console. You can insert additional fields or modify the generated `JSON`. The overrides that are visible in the `JSON` on the **Summary page** are what is used to override the default settings when the ordering node is deployed. **If you are deploying multiple ordering nodes, then the overrides are applied to each ordering node.**

You don't need to include the entire set of available parameters in the `JSON`, only any advanced deployment options that you selected in the console along with the parameters that you want to override. For example, if did not select any advanced options in the console and you want to deploy the ordering nodes with your own value for the  `ServerTimeout` and the `statsd address` port, you would paste the following `JSON` into the **Configuration JSON** box:

```json
{
    "General": {
        "Keepalive": {
            "ServerTimeout": "60s"
        }
    },
    "metrics": {
        "statsd": {
            "address": "127.0.0.1:9446"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Modifying ordering node settings after deployment
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-orderer-modify-json}

After an ordering node is deployed, a subset of the fields can be updated as well. Click the ordering service tile in the console and select the ordering node, then click the **Settings** icon to open a side panel where you can modify the `JSON`.  The `JSON` in the **Current configuration** box contains the current settings for the ordering node. **Not all of these values can be overridden after deployment.** Again, you don't need to include the entire set of parameters from the **Current configuration** `JSON`, only paste the parameters you want to override into the **Configuration JSON** box.

## Using certificates from an external CA with your peer or ordering service
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-third-party-ca}

Instead of using an {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Certificate Authority as your peer or ordering service's CA, you can use certificates from an external CA, one that is not hosted by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}. To use an external CA, the CA needs to issue certificates in [X.509](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/identity/identity.html#digital-certificates){: external} format. You need to generate your private keys using the PKCS #8 standard. For a quick tutorial, see [Using certificates from an external Certificate Authority](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-tutorial-extca).

### Before you begin
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-third-party-ca-prereq}

1. You need to gather the following certificate information and save it to individual files that can be uploaded to the console.   
**Note:** The certificates inside the files can be in either `PEM` format or `base64 encoded` format.
    * **Peer or ordering node identity certificate** This is the signing certificate from your external CA that the peer or ordering node will use. This certificate must contain the Organizational Unit (OU) attribute "peer" or "orderer" depending on the type of node it is used for.
    * **Peer or ordering node identity private key** This is your private key corresponding to the signed certificate from your third-party CA that this peer or ordering node will use.
    * **Peer or ordering service TLS CA certificate** This is the public signing certificate created by your external TLS CA that will be used by this peer or ordering node. The certificate needs to contain the x.509 Subject alternative name (SAN) for the peer or ordering nodes. If you are using the [Fabric CA client](https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/clientcli.html) to enroll the identity, you specify the SAN by passing the `--csr.hosts` parameter on the `enroll` command. If the host name is not yet known, you can specify a wild card with the domain name, for example: `--csr.hosts '*.ibpv2-cluster.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud,127.0.0.1'`.
    * **Peer or ordering service TLS CA private key** This is the private key corresponding to the signed certificate from your TLS CA that will be used by this peer or ordering node for secure communications with other members on the network.
    * **CA root certificate** (Optional) This is the root certificate of your external CA. You can also provide an intermediate CA root certificate or both.
    * **TLS CA root certificate** (Optional) This is the root certificate of your external TLS CA. You must provide either a TLS CA root certificate or an intermediate TLS CA certificate, you can also provide both.
    * **Intermediate CA TLS certificate**: (Optional) This is the TLS certificate if your TLS certificate is issued by an intermediate TLS CA. Upload the intermediate TLS CA certificate. You must provide either a TLS CA root certificate or an intermediate TLS CA certificate, you may also provide both.
    * **Peer or ordering service admin identity certificate** This is the signing certificate from your external CA that the admin identity of this peer or ordering service will use. This certificate is also known as your peer or ordering service admin identity key. This certificate must contain the OU attribute "admin".
    * **Peer or ordering service admin identity private key** This is the private key corresponding to the signed certificate from your external CA that the admin identity of this peer or ordering service will use.
    * **Peer or ordering service organization MSP definition** You must manually generate this file by using instructions that are provided in [Manually building an MSP JSON file](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-organizations#console-organizations-build-msp).

2. Import the generated peer or ordering service organization MSP definition file into the console, by clicking the **Organizations** tab followed by **Import MSP definition**.

Now you have the choice of creating a peer or single-node ordering service node, or ,if you have a paid cluster, a five node ordering service.

#### Consideration when using an external CA to generate certificates
{: #ibp-console-govern-third-party-openssl}

If a generated private key is in PKCS #1 format, before it can be used by the console, it needs to be converted to PKCS #8 format by running the following openssl command:
```
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -nocrypt -in identity.1.pem -out identity.8.pem
```
{: codeblock}

Replace:
- `identity.1.pem` with the name of the PKCS #1 private key `.PEM` file.
- `identity.8.pem` with the name that you want to give your PKCS #8 private key `.PEM` file.

Now the private key can be used by the console. If you plan to include it in an [organization MSP](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-organizations#console-organizations-build-msp) file, it needs to be encoded in base64 format.

### Option 1: Create a new peer or single-node ordering service using certificates from an external CA
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-third-party-ca-create-peer-orderer}

You can skip to **Option 2** if you want to create a new five node ordering service. The following instructions are only for creating a peer or single-node ordering service with certificates from your external CA.
{: note}

Now that you have gathered all the necessary certificates, you are ready to create a peer or ordering service that uses those certificates. Follow these instructions to create the peer or single-node ordering service with certificates from an external CA.

1. On the **Nodes** tab, click **Add peer** or **Add ordering service**.
2. Make sure the option to **Create** the peer or ordering service is selected. Then click **Next**.
3. After you enter a display name for the node, select the option to use an external CA.
4. Step through the panels and upload the files corresponding to the certificate and private key you gathered.
5. Ensure you select the peer or ordering service organization MSP definition that you imported into the console from the drop-down list.
6. On the last step when you are asked to associate an identity with your peer or ordering service, you need to click **New identity**.
7. Specify any value as the **Display name** for this identity. The display name will be visible in the Wallet after you create the node.
8. In the **Certificate** field, upload the file that contains the **Peer or ordering service admin identity certificate**.
9. In the **Private key** field, upload the file that contains the **Peer or ordering service admin identity private key**.
10. Review the information on the Summary page and click **Add peer** or **Add ordering service**.
11. After you have created the peer or ordering node, you can upload the orderer admin identity to the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} console. On the **Wallet** tab, click **Add identity**:
    - In the **Name** field, enter an identity name that is used for your reference only.
    - In the **Certificate** field, upload a file that contains the admin identity's signing certificate (in base64 or PEM format).
    - In the **Private Key** field, upload a file that contains the admin identity's private key (in base64 or PEM format).  

    After you upload the certificate and private key of the identity to the console, you can use the console associate the identity with the peer or ordering node.

### Option 2: Create a five node ordering service using certificates from an external CA
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-create-five-node}

When you have a paid Kubernetes cluster on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you  have the additional option of deploying a five node ordering service that uses the Raft consensus protocol. Before you deploy a five node ordering service, you need to build a `JSON` file that contains all of the certificates for the five nodes by using the following instructions:

#### Create the certificates JSON file
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-create-certs-file}

The required certificates `JSON` file contains an array of five `msp` entries, where each array element contains the certificates for one of the ordering nodes. You must specify unique certificates for each node. Do not reuse certificates across the different ordering nodes. The certificates in the `component` section represent the certificates for the node itself, while the `tls` section includes the certificates issued by the TLS CA.  

- **keystore**: The private key for this node
- **signcerts**: The public key (also known as a signing certificate or enrollment certificate) assigned by the CA for this node.
- **cacerts**: The certificate of the root CA.
- **admincerts**: The certificate of the admin users of the node. This might also be the admin of the organization.
- **intermediatecerts**: If your network includes multi-level CAs, paste in the certificate of the intermediate CA. If you did not use an intermediate certificate, you can leave this field blank.

Using the certificates that you gathered above, paste in the corresponding certificate in the fields below, in base64 format.

You can convert the contents of your certificate file, `<cert.pem>` from `PEM` format into a base64 string by running the following command on your local machine:

```
export FLAG=$(if [ "$(uname -s)" == "Linux" ]; then echo "-d"; else echo "-b 0"; fi)
cat <cert.pem> | base64 $FLAG
```

Save this definition as a ``JSON`` file.

#### Create the ordering service and use the certificates from the external CA for each ordering node
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-create-five-node-os}

After you create the `JSON` file with all of the certificates for the ordering nodes, you are ready to create the ordering service.

1. On the **Nodes** tab, click **Add ordering service**.
2. Make sure the option to **Create** an ordering service is selected. Then click **Next**.
3. Enter a single **Display name** for the five ordering nodes. The display name that you provide will be the prefix for each ordering node name and a number will be appended to it.
4. In **Number of ordering nodes**, select **Five ordering nodes**. Then select **External Certificate Authority configuration** and click **Next**.
5. Click **Add file** to upload the `JSON` file that contains all of the certificates.
6. Select the **Organization MSP** definition that you imported.
7. Because you are using a paid cluster, on  the next panel, you have the opportunity to configure resource allocation for the nodes. The selections that you make here are applied to all five ordering nodes. If you want to learn more about how to allocate resources to your node, see this topic on [Allocating resources](#ibp-console-adv-deployment-allocate-resources).
8. Review the summary and click **Add ordering service**.
9. After you have created the ordering service, you can upload the orderer admin identity to the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} console. On the **Wallet** tab, click **Add identity**:
    - In the **Name** field, enter an identity name that is used for your reference only.
    - In the **Certificate** field, upload a file that contains the admin identity's signing certificate (in base64 or PEM format).
    - In the **Private Key** field, upload a file that contains the admin identity's private key (in base64 or PEM format).  

    After you upload the certificate and private key of the identity to the console, you can use the console associate the identity with your ordering node.

#### What's next
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-third-party-ca-next}

You have gathered all of your peer or ordering service certificates from your third-party CA, created their corresponding organization MSP definition and created a peer or ordering service. If you are following along in the tutorials, you can return to the next step.
- If you created the peer node, the next step is to [Create the node that orders transactions](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-build-network#ibp-console-build-network-create-orderer).

## Configuring a node to use a Hardware Security Module (HSM)
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-cfg-hsm}

Key management is a critical aspect of managing a blockchain network. Because private keys are not stored by the platform, users are responsible for downloading and securing the private key of their node identities. In a production network, when a higher level of security is required for private keys, an HSM is an optional hardware appliance that performs cryptographic operations and provides the capability to ensure that the private keys never leave the HSM. Currently, Hyperledger Fabric supports HSM devices that implement the [PKCS #11 standard](http://docs.oasis-open.org/pkcs11/pkcs11-base/v2.40/os/pkcs11-base-v2.40-os.html){: external}. PKCS #11 is a cryptographic standard for secure operations, generation, and storage of keys.

The ability to configure a node to use HSM is available only in paid clusters.
{: note} 

### What capability does HSM add to my blockchain node?
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-cfg-hsm-capability}

When a CA, peer, or ordering node is configured to use an HSM, their private key is generated by and protected inside the HSM. Only the private keys of node identities are secured in the HSM. When a CA is configured to use HSM, the CA root private key is stored in the HSM. This is the key that is used to sign enrollment requests. After a peer or ordering node is configured to use HSM, the nodes are able to sign and endorse transactions without ever exposing their private key. It is important to understand though that when you register other node admin or client application identities with a CA by using the console, their private keys are not stored inside the HSM because they will need their private key to transact on the network.  

### Considerations when using HSM
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-cfg-hsm-considerations}

* When you configure your HSM, you will create a `partition` and a `PIN` for the slot on the HSM.
* A single partition can be used to generate and store multiple keys.
* Multiple blockchain nodes can share an HSM configuration, however it is recommended that one HSM is configured per organization.
* An HSM is not configured for an ordering service. Rather it is configured at the ordering node level inside the ordering service. Consider the case when different organizations contribute ordering nodes to an ordering service, it is possible that some organizations may want to use an HSM for the private key for their ordering node, while other organizations may not have that requirement. But all of the ordering nodes can still function together in the ordering service nonetheless.
* The use of an HSM introduces an increase in transaction processing, therefore you can expect a performance hit when using an HSM to manage the private keys for your nodes.
* An HSM can be configured for a node only when the node is initially deployed. You cannot add HSM capability to existing nodes at this time.

Configuring a node to use HSM is a three-part process:
1. **Deploy an HSM**. Utilize the HSM appliance that is available in [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/infrastructure/hardware-security-module){: external} or configure your own HSM. Record the value of the HSM `partition` and `PIN` to be used in the subsequent steps.
    - If you plan to use {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} HSM see this [tutorial](/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-hsm-gemalto) for an example of how to configure {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} HSM 6.0 with the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform. After that is completed you can skip to Part 3 **Configure the node to use HSM**. 
2. **Configure an HSM client image** [See Build a Docker image](#ibp-console-adv-deployment-hsm-build-docker).
3. **Configure the node to use HSM**.  From the APIs or the console, when you deploy a peer, CA, or ordering node, you can select the advanced option to use an HSM. See [Configure the node to use the HSM](#ibp-console-adv-deployment-cfg-hsm-node).

### Before you begin
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-hsm-before}

- The Kubernetes CLI is required to configure the HSM. If you are using a Kubernetes cluster on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} see [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started) or [Installing the OpenShift CLI](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift-cli).
- You need access to a container registry, such as Docker or the [{{site.data.keyword.registrylong_notm}}](/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-getting-started).


### Build a Docker image
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-hsm-build-docker}

Configure HSM on your blockchain network by **publishing an HSM client image to a container registry**, as described below.

**Build an HSM client image**
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-hsm-client}

Next we build a Docker file that contains the HSM client image. These instructions assume that you have successfully configured your HSM appliance and HSM client. Use these steps to generate an image that is consumable by the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform operator.

- Step one: Modify the HSM client configuration.
- Step two: Build the HSM client image.
- Step three: Push the Docker image to your container registry.
- Step four: Create a Kubernetes secret `hsmcrypto`.
- Step five: Create the HSM configmap.

#### Step one: Modify the HSM client configuration
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-hsm-client-cfg}

Each HSM has its own configuration file that is typically named `Chrystoki.conf`.  This is the main configuration file for the HSM integration and controls many aspects of the HSM client operation. After you install the HSM client, you need to modify the `etc/Chrystoki.conf` file to point to the `hsm` folder that contains the  HSM shared object library and cryptographic material. The paths specified in `Chrystoki.conf` represent the location where the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform operator mounts these files on the containers. You need to modify parameters inside the `Chrystoki2` and `LunaSA Client` sections as follows:

**Chrystoki2 settings**  
- **LibUnix:** Name of the Chrystoki2 library on x86 Linux/UNIX operating systems. The actual name of the library depends on the type of HSM you are using.
- **LibUNIX64:** Name of the Chrystoki2 library on 64-bit Linux/UNIX operating systems. The actual name of the library depends on the type of HSM you are using.  

**LunaSA Client  settings** Typically no changes would be required here unless you have explicitly modified the names of these files.
- **ClientPrivKeyFile:** Name of the HSM client private key.
- **ClientCertFile:**  Name of the HSM client certificate.
- **ServerCAFile:**  Name of the HSM server certificate.

The following example shows what the file would look like if you were using {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} HSM. It provides the path to the HSM shared object, certificate and keys. Note that the naming of these files depends on the HSM library that is being used.

```
Chrystoki2 = {
    LibUNIX = /hsm/libCryptoki2.so;
    LibUNIX64 = /hsm/libCryptoki2_64.so;
}
...
LunaSA Client = {
...
    ClientPrivKeyFile = /hsm/key.pem;
    ClientCertFile = /hsm/cert.pem;
    ServerCAFile = /hsm/cafile.pem;
...
}
```
{: codeblock}

#### Step two: Build the HSM client image
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-hsm-client-docker}

The HSM client image can be built with a Docker file similar to the following:

- The following Docker file is for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} HSM. If you are not using {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} HSM, you need to build your own Docker file.
- You should be aware that this Docker file automatically accepts the Gemalto client license.
- Note that the `64` folder inside the Docker file is required for installing the HSM client.

```
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal as builder

## This directory contains the installation files for gemalto/luna client
COPY 64 64

RUN microdnf install -y \
    gcc \
    gcc-c++ \
    openssh-clients \
    bind-utils \
    iputils \
    && cd 64 && \
    # NOTE we are accepting the license for installing gemalto client here
    # please take a look at the license before moving forward
    echo "y" | ./install.sh -p sa

### Final image ###

FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal

# Copy the library files from builder
COPY --from=builder /usr/lib/libCryptoki2_64.so /usr/lib/libCryptoki2_64.so
COPY --from=builder /usr/lib/libCryptoki2_64.so.2 /usr/lib/libCryptoki2_64.so.2
COPY --from=builder /usr/lib/libCryptoki2_64.so.6.3.0 /usr/lib/libCryptoki2_64.so.6.3.0
```
{: codeblock}

Now, run the following command to build the Docker image:

```
docker build -t hsm-client:v1 -f Dockerfile .
```
{: codeblock}

#### Step three: Push the Docker image to your container registry
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-hsm-client-push}

After the image is built, the next step is to push the image to your Docker registry (for example, Docker Hub). The commands look similar to:

```
docker login -u <DOCKER_HUB_ID> -p <DOCKER_HUB_PWD>
docker tag hsm-client:v1 <DOCKER_HUB_ID>/hsm-client:v1
docker push <DOCKER_HUB_ID>/hsm-client:v1
```
{: codeblock}

- Replace `<DOCKER_HUB_ID>` with your Docker Hub id.
- Replace `<DOCKER_HUB_PWD>` with your Docker Hub password.


**Create a Kubernetes image pull secret**

If the HSM client image that you published is not public, then the operator requires an `image pull secret` that contains a valid username and password (or access token) for the container registry. If the image is public, the imagepullsecret is not required and you can skip this command. To build the image pull secret named `hsm-docker-secret`, run the following command in the namespace or project where you deployed the service:

```
kubectl create secret docker-registry hsm-docker-secret --docker-server=<DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER> --docker-username=<DOCKER_USER> --docker-password=<DOCKER_PASSWORD> --docker-email=<DOCKER_EMAIL> -n <NAMESPACE>
```
{: codeblock}

Replace:
- `DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER` - Registry server url where the HSM client image is hosted.
- `DOCKER_USER` - Valid username with access to HSM client image in the container registry.
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD` - Valid password or access token for the HSM client image in the container registry.
- `DOCKER_EMAIL` - Email address for container registry user.
- `NAMESPACE` - Name of the  project or namespace that is visible on the console **Support** page.

These instructions are obviously for the Docker registry. If you are using the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Container Registry, then you need to set up your own image pull secret in your cluster:

    - [Using an image pull secret to access images in other IBM Cloud accounts or external private registries from non-default Kubernetes namespaces](/docs/containers?topic=containers-registry#other)
    - [Copying an existing image pull secret](/docs/containers?topic=containers-registry#copy_imagePullSecret)
    - [Referring to the image pull secret in your pod deployment](/docs/containers?topic=containers-images#pod_imagePullSecret)

#### Step four: Create a Kubernetes secret `hsmcrypto`
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-hsm-client-crypto}

In order for a CA, peer, or ordering node to be able to communicate with the HSM client image you need to
create a Kubernetes secret named `hsmcrypto` that contains the keys and configuration files for the HSM that you are using. When the console deploys a node that is configured with HSM, it uses this secret to access the HSM client image keys and configuration files.

The Kubernetes secret needs to be created in the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}}  Platform service instance namespace that is visible on the console **Support** page.    If you are using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} HSM, the command would be:

```
$ kubectl create secret generic hsmcrypto -n <NAMESPACE> --from-file=Chrystoki.conf --from-file=cert.pem --from-file=key.pem --from-file=server.pem
```
{: codeblock}

Replace `<NAMESPACE>` with the name of your  service instance namespace or OpenShift project If you are not using {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} HSM, you need to replace the values of the `--from-file` parameters with the set of certificates and configuration files that are required for your HSM client image.

When successful, the output looks similar to:
```
secret/hsmcrypto created
```

To verify the contents of the secret, run the command:
```
kubectl get secret -n <namespace> hsmcrypto -o yaml
```
{: codeblock}

You should see results similar to:
```
apiVersion: v1
data:
  Chrystoki.conf: ""
  cafile.pem: ""
  cert.pem: ""
  key.pem: ""
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: hsmcrypto
  namespace: <NAMESPACE>
```

#### Step five: Create the HSM configmap
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-hsm-configmap}





Copy the following text and save it to a file named `ibp-hsm-config.yaml`:

```yaml
version: v1
type: hsm
resources:
    limits: {}
    requests: {}
securityContext:
    privileged: false
    runAsNonRoot: false
    runAsUser: 0
library:
  image: <HSM_IMAGE_URL>
  auth:
    imagePullSecret: <IMAGE_PULL_SECRET>
  filepath: <HSM_LIBRARY_FILE_PATH>
envs:  
- name: <ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME>
  value: <ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_VALUE>
mountpaths:
- mountpath: <MOUNTPATH>
  name: <MOUNTPATH_NAME>
  secret: <HSM_CRYPTO_SECRET>
  paths:
  - key: <KEY>
    path: <PATH>
  - key: <KEY>
    path: <PATH>
- mountpath: <MOUNTPATH>
  name: <MOUNTPATH_NAME>
  secret: <HSM_CRYPTO_SECRET>
  paths:
  - key: <KEY>
    path: <PATH>
  - key: <KEY>
    path: <PATH>
```
{: codeblock}

Replace the following values:
- `HSM_IMAGE_URL`: URL of the HSM client image that you published to your container registry.
- `IMAGE_PULL_SECRET`: (Optional)  Name of the image pull secret `hsm-docker-secret` that you created in the same namespace as your service. Only required if the HSM client image is not publicly available. **Important:** If an image pull secret is not required, set this value to `""`.
- `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME` - If there are any environment variables that need to be set for the HSM client, specify them individually.
- `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_VALUE` - Value that corresponds to the `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME`.
- `HSM_LIBRARY_FILE_PATH`: Path to the HSM library file, for example, `/usr/lib/libCryptoki2_64.so`.
- `MOUNTPATH`: Location where the file or folder should be mounted.
- `MOUNTPATH_NAME`: Name you want to use for the `mountpath`.
- `KEY`:  Name of the key inside the `hsmcrypto` Kubernetes secret.
- `PATH`: Mount location of the file path where the key should be mounted.
- `HSM_CRYPTO_SECRET`: Name of the Kubernetes secret that contains the keys and configuration files for the HSM that is used by the `mountpath`.

Each HSM likely has a different set of keys that are required by the HSM client. Optionally replicate the "`key`" and "`path`" sections according to the number required by your HSM client. Similarly, if multiple sets of folders need to be mounted, you can replicate the "`mountpath`" section.  

For example, if you are using {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} HSM, the file looks similar to:

```yaml
version: v1
type: hsm
library:
  image: us.icr.io/hsm/gemalto-client:v1.2.3-amd64
  auth:
    imagePullSecret: hsm-docker-secret
  filepath: /usr/lib/libCryptoki2_64.so
mountpaths:
- mountpath: /hsm
  name: hsmcrypto
  paths:
  - key: cafile.pem
    path: cafile.pem
  - key: cert.pem
    path: cert.pem
  - key: key.pem
    path: key.pem
  - key: server.pem
    path: server.pem
  secret: hsmcrypto
- mountpath: /etc/Chrystoki.conf
  name: hsmconfig
  secret: hsmcrypto
  subpath: Chrystoki.conf
```
{: codeblock}

In this example, the first `mountpath` contains four configuration files (cafile.pem, cert.pem, key.pem, server.pem) and the `hsmcrypto` secret, and all of them are mounted to the mountpath `/hsm`. The actual name of the mountpath is `hsmcrypto`, and it contains an exact mapping of the key value pair to the Kubernetes secret and the location to mount it to. For example, `cafile.pem` is read from the path `cafile.pem` in the hsmcrypto mountpath using the `hsmcrypto` secret and mounted to `/hsm/cafile.pem`.  

A second mountpath is included for the HSM `/etc/Chrystoki.conf` file. Because the HSM requires its config file in the `/etc` folder, which is a system directory, we need to use the `subpath` parameter to avoid replacing the entire `/etc` directory. If the subpath is not used, the entire `/etc` directory is replaced with the volume being mounted.  


Run the following command to create the configmap named `ibp-hsm-config` in your cluster namespace or project:
```
kubectl create configmap ibp-hsm-config --from-file=ibp-hsm-config.yaml -n <NAMESPACE>
```
{: codeblock}

The output looks similar to:

```
configmap/ibp-hsm-config created
```

### Configuring a CA, peer, or ordering node to use the HSM
{: #ibp-console-adv-deployment-cfg-hsm-node}

Before attempting these steps you should have:
- Deployed an HSM for your cluster.
- Created a partition and PIN for the slot.
- Deployed the HSM client image or the HSM proxy for your organization.

When a node is configured with HSM, a temporary Kubernetes job is started to run this HSM "enrollment" process. Before configuring a node to use HSM, ensure that you have enough resources in your cluster to support this job that takes approximately 0.1CPU and 100Mi memory.
{: important}

Then you are ready to deploy a new CA, peer, or ordering node that uses the HSM.

When you deploy a new node from the console, ensure that you select the advanced deployment option **Hardware security module (HSM)**. This option is only available on paid clusters.

If you published an HSM client image and created the HSM configmap, the **Use HSM client image** toggle is visible. When it is on, you can enter the following values:

- **HSM label** - Enter the name of the HSM partition to be used for this node.
- **HSM PIN** - Enter the PIN for the HSM slot.  

If you did not create the HSM configmap, an additional field is required:

- **HSM proxy endpoint** -Enter the URL for the endpoint.

Lastly, on the CA **Summary** panel, you can override the default HSM configuration, for example if you want to customize which crypto library implementation to use. Click **Edit configuration JSON (Advanced)** on the **Summary** panel to view the `JSON`. Scroll down to the `BCCSP (Blockchain Crypto Service Provider) section` where you can modify the crypto library settings.

When the node is deployed, a private key for the specified node enroll ID and secret is generated by the HSM and stored securely in the appliance.
