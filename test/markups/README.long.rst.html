<a name="listener-enhancements"></a>
<h3><a href="#toc-entry-3">Listener enhancements</a></h3>
<p>Robot Framework's <a href="http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#listener-interface">listener interface</a> is a very powerful mechanism to get
notifications about various events during execution and it also allows modifying
data and results on the fly. It is not typically directly used by normal Robot
Framework users, but they are likely to use tools that use it internally.
The listener API has been significantly enhanced making it possible
to create even more powerful and interesting tools in the future.</p>
<a name="support-keywords-and-control-structures-with-listener-version-3"></a>
<h4>Support keywords and control structures with listener version 3</h4>
<p>The major limitation with the listener API has been that the listener
API version 2 only supports getting notifications, not making modifications,
and that the more powerful listener API version 3 has only supported suites
and tests/tasks.</p>
<p>The biggest enhancement in the whole Robot Framework 7.0 is that the listener
version 3 has been extended to support also keywords and control structures (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3296">#3296</a>).
For example, a listener having the following methods prints information
about started keywords and ended WHILE loops:</p>
<pre lang="python">
from robot import result, running


def start_keyword(data: running.Keyword, result: result.Keyword):
    print(f"Keyword '{result.full_name}' used on line {data.lineno} started.")


def end_while(data: running.While, result: result.While):
    print(f"WHILE loop on line {data.lineno} ended with status {result.status} "
          f"after {len(result.body)} iterations.")
</pre>
<p>With keyword calls it is possible to also get more information about the actually
executed keyword. For example, the following listener prints some information
about the executed keyword and the library it belongs to:</p>
<pre lang="python">
from robot.running import Keyword as KeywordData, LibraryKeyword
from robot.result import Keyword as KeywordResult


def start_library_keyword(data: KeywordData,
                          implementation: LibraryKeyword,
                          result: KeywordResult):
    library = implementation.owner
    print(f"Keyword '{implementation.name}' is implemented in library "
          f"'{library.name}' at '{implementation.source}' on line "
          f"{implementation.lineno}. The library has {library.scope.name} "
          f"scope and the current instance is {library.instance}.")
</pre>
<p>As the above example already illustrated, it is even possible to get an access to
the actual library instance. This means that listeners can inspect the library
state and also modify it. With user keywords it is even possible to modify
the keyword itself or, via the <code>owner</code> resource file, any other keyword in
the resource file.</p>
<p>Listeners can also modify results if needed. Possible use cases include hiding
sensitive information and adding more details to results based on external sources.</p>
<p>Notice that although listener can change status of any executed keyword or control
structure, that does not directly affect the status of the executed test. In general
listeners cannot directly fail keywords so that execution would stop or handle
failures so that execution would continue. This kind of functionality may be
added in the future if there are needs.</p>
<p>The new listener version 3 methods are so powerful and versatile that going them
through thoroughly in these release notes is not possible. For more examples, you
can see the <a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/tree/master/atest/testdata/output/listener_interface/body_items_v3">acceptance tests</a> using the methods in various interesting and even
crazy ways.</p>
<a name="listener-version-3-is-the-default-listener-version"></a>
<h4>Listener version 3 is the default listener version</h4>
<p>Earlier listeners always needed to specify the API version they used with the
<code>ROBOT_LISTENER_API_VERSION</code> attribute. Now that the listener version 3 got
the new methods, it is considered so much more powerful than the version 2
that it was made the default listener version (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4910">#4910</a>).</p>
<p>The listener version 2 continues to work, but using it requires specifying
the listener version as earlier. The are no plans to deprecate the listener
version 2, but we nevertheless highly recommend using the version 3 whenever
possible.</p>
<a name="libraries-can-register-themselves-as-listeners-by-using-string-self"></a>
<h4>Libraries can register themselves as listeners by using string <code>SELF</code>
</h4>
<p>Listeners are typically enabled from the command line, but libraries
can register listeners as well. Often libraries themselves want to act
as listeners, and that has earlier required using <code>self.ROBOT_LIBRARY_LISTENER¬†=¬†self</code>
in the <code>__init__</code> method. Robot Framework 7.0 makes it possible to use string
<code>SELF</code> (case-insensitive) for this purpose as well (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4910">#4910</a>), which means
that a listener can be specified as a class attribute and not only in <code>__init__</code>.
This is especially convenient when using the <code>@library</code> decorator:</p>
<pre lang="python">
from robot.api.deco import keyword, library


@library(listener='SELF')
class Example:

    def start_suite(self, data, result):
        ...

    @keyword
    def example(self, arg):
        ...
</pre>
<a name="nicer-api-for-modifying-keyword-arguments"></a>
<h4>Nicer API for modifying keyword arguments</h4>
<p>Modifying keyword call arguments programmatically has been made more convenient
(<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5000">#5000</a>). This enhancement eases modifying arguments using the new listener
version 3 <code>start/end_keyword</code> methods.</p>
<a name="paths-are-passed-to-version-3-listeners-as-pathlib-path-objects"></a>
<h4>Paths are passed to version 3 listeners as <code>pathlib.Path</code> objects</h4>
<p>Listeners have methods like <code>output_file</code> and <code>log_file</code> that are called when
result files are ready so that they get the file path as an argument. Earlier
paths were strings, but nowadays listener version 3 methods get them as
more convenient <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html">pathlib.Path</a> objects.</p>
<a name="native-var-syntax"></a>
<h3><a href="#toc-entry-4">Native <code>VAR</code> syntax</a></h3>
<p>The new <code>VAR</code> syntax (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3761">#3761</a>) makes it possible to create local variables
as well as global, suite and test/task scoped variables dynamically during
execution. The motivation is to have a more convenient syntax than using
the <code>Set Variable</code> keyword for creating local variables and to unify
the syntax for creating variables in different scopes. Except for the mandatory
<code>VAR</code> marker, the syntax is also the same as when creating variables in the
Variables section. The syntax is best explained with examples:</p>
<pre lang="robotframework">
*** Test Cases ***
Example
    # Create a local variable `${local}` with a value `value`.
    VAR    ${local}    value

    # Create a variable that is available throughout the whole suite.
    # Supported scopes are GLOBAL, SUITE, TEST, TASK and LOCAL (default).
    VAR    ${suite}    value    scope=SUITE

    # Validate created variables.
    Should Be Equal    ${local}    value
    Should Be Equal    ${suite}    value

Example continued
    # Suite level variables are seen also by subsequent tests.
    Should Be Equal    ${suite}    value
</pre>
<p>When creating <code>${scalar}</code> variables having long values, it is possible to split
the value to multiple lines. Lines are joined together with a space by default,
but that can be changed with the <code>separator</code> configuration option. Similarly as
in the Variables section, it is possible to create also <code>@{list}</code> and <code>&amp;{dict}</code>
variables. Unlike in the Variables section, variables can be created conditionally
using IF/ELSE structures:</p>
<pre lang="robotframework">
*** Test Cases ***
Long value
    VAR    ${long}
    ...    This value is rather long.
    ...    It has been split to multiple lines.
    ...    Parts will be joined together with a space.

Multiline
    VAR    ${multiline}
    ...    First line.
    ...    Second line.
    ...    Last line.
    ...    separator=\n

List
    # Creates a list with three items.
    VAR    @{list}    a    b    c

Dictionary
    # Creates a dictionary with two items.
    VAR    &amp;{dict}    key=value    second=item

Normal IF
    IF    1 &gt; 0
        VAR    ${x}    true value
    ELSE
        VAR    ${x}    false value
    END

Inline IF
    IF    1 &gt; 0    VAR    ${x}    true value    ELSE    VAR    ${x}    false value
</pre>
<a name="mixed-argument-support-with-library-keywords"></a>
<h3><a href="#toc-entry-5">Mixed argument support with library keywords</a></h3>
<p>User keywords got support to use both embedded and normal arguments in Robot
Framework 6.1 (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4234">#4234</a>) and now that support has been added also to library keywords
(<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4710">#4710</a>). The syntax works so, that if a function or method implementing a keyword
accepts more arguments than there are embedded arguments, the remaining arguments
can be passed in as normal arguments. This is illustrated by the following example
keyword:</p>
<pre lang="python">
@keyword('Number of ${animals} should be')
def example(animals, count):
    ...
</pre>
<p>The above keyword could be used like this:</p>
<pre lang="robotframework">
*** Test Cases ***
Example
    Number of horses should be    2
    Number of horses should be    count=2
    Number of dogs should be    3
</pre>
<a name="json-result-format"></a>
<h3><a href="#toc-entry-6">JSON result format</a></h3>
<p>Robot Framework 6.1 added support to <a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/blob/master/doc/releasenotes/rf-6.1.rst#json-data-format">convert test/task data to JSON and back</a>
and Robot Framework 7.0 extends the JSON serialization support to execution results
(<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4847">#4847</a>). One of the core use cases for data serialization was making it easy to
transfer data between process and machines, and now it is also easy to pass results
back.</p>
<p>Also the built-in Rebot tool that is used for post-processing results supports
JSON files both in output and in input. Creating JSON output files is done using
the normal <code>--output</code> option so that the specified file has a <code>.json</code> extension:</p>
<pre>
rebot --output output.json output.xml
</pre>
<p>When reading output files, JSON files are automatically recognized by
the extension:</p>
<pre>
rebot output.json
rebot output1.json output2.json
</pre>
<p>When combining or merging results, it is possible to mix JSON and XML files:</p>
<pre>
rebot output1.xml output2.json
rebot --merge original.xml rerun.json
</pre>
<p>The JSON output file structure is documented in the <code>result.json</code> <a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/tree/master/doc/schema#readme">schema file</a>.</p>
<p>The plan is to enhance the support for JSON output files in the future so that
they could be created already during execution. For more details see issue <a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3423">#3423</a>.</p>
<a name="argument-conversion-enhancements"></a>
<h3><a href="#toc-entry-7">Argument conversion enhancements</a></h3>
<p>Automatic argument conversion is a very powerful feature that library developers
can use to avoid converting arguments manually and to get more useful Libdoc
documentation. There are two important new enhancements to it.</p>
<a name="support-for-literal"></a>
<h4>Support for <code>Literal</code>
</h4>
<p>In Python, the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Literal">Literal</a> type makes it possible to type arguments so that type
checkers accept only certain values. For example, this function only accepts
strings <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>z</code>:</p>
<pre lang="python">
def example(arg: Literal['x', 'y', 'z']):
    ...
</pre>
<p>Robot Framework has been enhanced so that it validates that an argument having
a <code>Literal</code> type can only be used with the specified values (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4633">#4633</a>). For
example, using a keyword with the above implementation with a value <code>xxx</code> would
fail.</p>
<p>In addition to validation, arguments are also converted. For example, if an
argument accepts <code>Literal[-1,¬†0,¬†1]</code>, used arguments are converted to
integers and then validated. In addition to that, string matching is case, space,
underscore and hyphen insensitive. In all cases exact matches have a precedence
and the argument that is passed to the keyword is guaranteed to be in the exact
format used with <code>Literal</code>.</p>
<p><code>Literal</code> conversion is in many ways similar to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html">Enum</a> conversion that Robot
Framework has supported for long time. <code>Enum</code> conversion has benefits like
being able to use a custom documentation and it is typically better when using
the same type multiple times. In simple cases being able to just use
<code>arg:¬†Literal[...]</code> without defining a new type is very convenient, though.</p>
<a name="support-stringified-types-like-list-int-and-int-float"></a>
<h4>Support  "stringified" types like <code>'list[int]'</code> and <code>'int | float'</code>
</h4>
<p>Python's type hinting syntax has evolved so that generic types can be parameterized
like <code>list[int]</code> (new in <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0585">Python 3.9</a>) and unions written as <code>int | float</code>
(new in <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0604">Python 3.10</a>). Using these constructs with older Python versions causes
errors, but Python type checkers support also "stringified" type hints like
<code>'list[int]'</code> and <code>'int | float'</code> that work regardless the Python version.</p>
<p>Support for stringified generics and unions has now been added also to
Robot Framework's argument conversion (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4711">#4711</a>). For example,
the following typing now also works with Python 3.8:</p>
<pre lang="python">
def example(a: 'list[int]', b: 'int | float'):
    ...
</pre>
<p>These stringified types are also compatible with the Remote library API and other
scenarios where using actual types is not possible.</p>
<a name="tags-set-globally-can-be-removed-using-tag-syntax"></a>
<h3><a href="#toc-entry-8">Tags set globally can be removed using <code>-tag</code> syntax</a></h3>
<p>Individual tests and keywords can nowadays remove tags that have been set in
the Settings section with <code>Test Tags</code> or <code>Keyword Tags</code> settings by using
the <code>-tag</code> syntax with their own <code>[Tags]</code> setting (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4374">#4374</a>). For example,
tests <code>T1</code> and <code>T3</code> below get tags <code>all</code> and <code>most</code>, and test <code>T2</code> gets
tags <code>all</code> and <code>one</code>:</p>
<pre lang="robotframework">
*** Settings ***
Test Tags      all    most

*** Test Cases ***
T1
    No Operation
T2
    [Tags]    one    -most
    No Operation
T3
    No Operation
</pre>
<p>With tests it is possible to get the same effect by using the <code>Default Tags</code>
setting and overriding it where needed. That syntax is, however, considered
deprecated (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4365">#4365</a>) and using the new <code>-tag</code> syntax is recommended. With
keywords there was no similar functionality earlier.</p>
<a name="dynamic-and-hybrid-library-apis-support-asynchronous-execution"></a>
<h3><a href="#toc-entry-9">Dynamic and hybrid library APIs support asynchronous execution</a></h3>
<p>Dynamic and hybrid libraries nowadays support asynchronous execution.
In practice the special methods like <code>get_keyword_names</code> and <code>run_keyword</code>
can be implemented as async methods (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4803">#4803</a>).</p>
<p>Async support was added to the normal static library API in Robot Framework
6.1 (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4089">#4089</a>). A bug related to handling asynchronous keywords if execution
is stopped gracefully has also been fixed (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4808">#4808</a>).</p>
<a name="timestamps-in-result-model-and-output-xml-use-standard-format"></a>
<h3><a href="#toc-entry-10">Timestamps in result model and output.xml use standard format</a></h3>
<p>Timestamps used in the result model and stored to the output.xml file used custom
format like <code>20231107 19:57:01.123</code> earlier. Non-standard formats are seldom
a good idea, and in this case parsing the custom format turned out to be slow
as well.</p>
<p>Nowadays the result model stores timestamps as standard <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime-objects">datetime</a> objects and
elapsed times as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects">timedelta</a> (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4258">#4258</a>). This makes creating timestamps and
operating with them more convenient and considerably faster. The new objects can
be accessed via <code>start_time</code>, <code>end_time</code> and <code>elapsed_time</code> attributes that were
added as forward compatibility already in Robot Framework 6.1 (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4765">#4765</a>).
Old information is still available via the old <code>starttime</code>, <code>endtime</code> and
<code>elapsedtime</code> attributes, so this change is fully backwards compatible.</p>
<p>The timestamp format in output.xml has also been changed from the custom
<code>YYYYMMDD HH:MM:SS.mmm</code> format to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> compatible
<code>YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmmmmm</code>. Using a standard format makes it
easier to process output.xml files, but this change also has big positive
performance effect. Now that the result model stores timestamps as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime-objects">datetime</a>
objects, formatting and parsing them with the available <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.isoformat">isoformat()</a> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.fromisoformat">fromisoformat()</a> methods is very fast compared to custom formatting and parsing.</p>
<p>A related change is that instead of storing start and end times of each executed
item in output.xml, we nowadays store their start and elapsed times. Elapsed times
are represented as floats denoting seconds. Having elapsed times directly available
is a lot more convenient than calculating them based on start and end times.
Storing start and elapsed times also takes less space than storing start and end times.</p>
<p>As the result of these changes, times are available in the result model and in
output.xml in higher precision than earlier. Earlier times were stored in millisecond
granularity, but nowadays they use microseconds. Logs and reports still use milliseconds,
but that can be changed in the future if there are needs.</p>
<p>Changes to output.xml are backwards incompatible and affect all external tools
that process timestamps. This is discussed more in <a href="#changes-to-output-xml">Changes to output.xml</a>
section below along with other output.xml changes.</p>
<a name="dark-mode-support-to-report-and-log"></a>
<h3><a href="#toc-entry-11">Dark mode support to report and log</a></h3>
<p>Report and log got a new dark mode (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3725">#3725</a>). It is enabled automatically based
on browser and operating system preferences, but there is also a toggle to
switch between the modes.</p>
<a name="backwards-incompatible-changes"></a>
<h2><a href="#toc-entry-12">Backwards incompatible changes</a></h2>
<a name="python-3-6-and-3-7-are-no-longer-supported"></a>
<h3><a href="#toc-entry-13">Python 3.6 and 3.7 are no longer supported</a></h3>
<p>Robot Framework 7.0 requires Python 3.8 or newer (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4294">#4294</a>). The last version
that supports Python 3.6 and 3.7 is Robot Framework 6.1.1.</p>
<a name="changes-to-output-xml"></a>
<h3><a href="#toc-entry-14">Changes to output.xml</a></h3>
<p>The output.xml file has changed in different ways making Robot Framework 7.0
incompatible with external tools processing output.xml files until these tools
are updated. We try to avoid this kind of breaking changes, but in this case
especially the changes to timestamps were considered so important that we
eventually would have needed to do them anyway.</p>
<p>Due to the changes being relatively big, it can take some time before external
tools are updated. To allow users to take Robot Framework 7.0 into use also
if they depend on an incompatible tool, it is possible to use the new
<code>--legacy-output</code> option both as part of execution and with the Rebot tool
to generate output.xml files that are compatible with older versions.</p>
<a name="timestamp-related-changes"></a>
<h4>Timestamp related changes</h4>
<p>The biggest changes in output.xml are related to timestamps (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4258">#4258</a>).
With earlier versions start and end times of executed items, as well as timestamps
of the logged messages, were stored using a custom <code>YYYYMMDD HH:MM:SS.mmm</code> format,
but nowadays the format is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> compatible <code>YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmmmmm</code>.
In addition to that, instead of saving start and end times to <code>starttime</code> and
<code>endtime</code> attributes and message times to <code>timestamp</code>, start and elapsed times
are now stored to <code>start</code> and <code>elapsed</code> attributes and message times to <code>time</code>.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre lang="xml">
&lt;!-- Old format --&gt;
&lt;msg timestamp="20231108 15:36:34.278" level="INFO"&gt;Hello world!&lt;/msg&gt;
&lt;status status="PASS" starttime="20231108 15:37:35.046" endtime="20231108 15:37:35.046"/&gt;

&lt;!-- New format --&gt;
&lt;msg time="2023-11-08T15:36:34.278343" level="INFO"&gt;Hello world!&lt;/msg&gt;
&lt;status status="PASS" start="2023-11-08T15:37:35.046153" elapsed="0.000161"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>The new format is standard compliant, contains more detailed times, makes the elapsed
time directly available and makes the <code>&lt;status&gt;</code> elements over 10% shorter.
These are all great benefits, but we are still sorry for all the extra work
this causes for those developing tools that process output.xml files.</p>
<a name="keyword-name-related-changes"></a>
<h4>Keyword name related changes</h4>
<p>How keyword names are stored in output.xml has changed slightly (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4884">#4884</a>).
With each executed keywords we store both the name of the keyword and the name
of the library or resource file containing it. Earlier the latter was stored to
attribute <code>library</code> also with resource files, but nowadays the attribute is generic
<code>owner</code>. In addition to <code>owner</code> being a better name in general, it also
matches the new <code>owner</code> attribute keywords in the result model have.</p>
<p>Another change is that the original name stored with keywords using embedded
arguments is nowadays in <code>source_name</code> attribute when it used to be in <code>sourcename</code>.
This change was done to make the attribute consistent with the attribute in
the result model.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre lang="xml">
&lt;!-- Old format --&gt;
&lt;kw name="Log" library="BuiltIn"&gt;...&lt;/kw&gt;
&lt;kw name="Number of horses should be" sourcename="Number of ${animals} should be" library="my_resource"&gt;...&lt;/kw&gt;

&lt;!-- New format --&gt;
&lt;kw name="Log" owner="BuiltIn"&gt;...&lt;/kw&gt;
&lt;kw name="Number of horses should be" source_name="Number of ${animals} should be" owner="my_resource"&gt;...&lt;/kw&gt;
</pre>
<a name="other-changes"></a>
<h4>Other changes</h4>
<p>Nowadays keywords and control structures can have a message. Messages are represented
as the text of the <code>&lt;status&gt;</code> element, and they have been present already earlier with
tests and suites. Related to this, control structured cannot anymore have <code>&lt;doc&gt;</code>.
(<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4883">#4883</a>)</p>
<p>These changes should not cause problems for tools processing output.xml files,
but storing messages with each failed keyword and control structure may
increase the output.xml size.</p>
<a name="schema-updates"></a>
<h4>Schema updates</h4>
<p>The output.xml schema has been updated and can be found via
<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/tree/master/doc/schema/">https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/tree/master/doc/schema/</a>.</p>
<a name="changes-to-result-model"></a>
<h3><a href="#toc-entry-15">Changes to result model</a></h3>
<p>There have been some changes to the result model that unfortunately affect
external tools using it. The main motivation for these changes has been
cleaning up the model before creating a JSON representation for it (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4847">#4847</a>).</p>
<a name="changes-related-to-keyword-names"></a>
<h4>Changes related to keyword names</h4>
<p>The biggest changes are related to keyword names (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4884">#4884</a>). Earlier <code>Keyword</code>
objects had a <code>name</code> attribute that contained the full keyword name like
<code>BuiltIn.Log</code>. The actual keyword name and the name of the library or resource
file that the keyword belonged to were in <code>kwname</code> and <code>libname</code> attributes,
respectively. In addition to these, keywords using embedded arguments also had
a <code>sourcename</code> attribute containing the original keyword name.</p>
<p>Due to reasons explained in <a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4884">#4884</a>, the following changes have been made
in Robot Framework 7.0:</p>
<ul>
<li>Old <code>kwname</code> is renamed to <code>name</code>. This is consistent with the execution side <code>Keyword</code>.</li>
<li>Old <code>libname</code> is renamed to generic <code>owner</code>.</li>
<li>New <code>full_name</code> is introduced to replace the old <code>name</code>.</li>
<li>
<code>sourcename</code> is renamed to <code>source_name</code>.</li>
<li>
<code>kwname</code>, <code>libname</code> and <code>sourcename</code> are preserved as properties. They are considered
deprecated, but accessing them does not cause a deprecation warning yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>The backwards incompatible part of this change is changing the meaning of the
<code>name</code> attribute. It used to be a read-only property yielding the full name
like <code>BuiltIn.Log</code>, but now it is a normal attribute that contains just the actual
keyword name like <code>Log</code>. All other old attributes have been preserved as properties
and code using them does not need to be updated immediately.</p>
<a name="deprecated-attributes-have-been-removed"></a>
<h4>Deprecated attributes have been removed</h4>
<p>The following attributes that were deprecated already in Robot Framework 4.0
have been removed (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4846">#4846</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>TestSuite.keywords</code>. Use <code>TestSuite.setup</code> and <code>TestSuite.teardown</code> instead.</li>
<li>
<code>TestCase.keywords</code>. Use <code>TestCase.body</code>, <code>TestCase.setup</code> and <code>TestCase.teardown</code> instead.</li>
<li>
<code>Keyword.keywords</code>. Use <code>Keyword.body</code> and <code>Keyword.teardown</code> instead.</li>
<li>
<code>Keyword.children</code>. Use <code>Keyword.body</code> and <code>Keyword.teardown</code> instead.</li>
<li>
<code>TestCase.critical</code>. The whole criticality concept has been removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, <code>TestSuite.keywords</code> and <code>TestCase.keywords</code> have been removed
from the execution model.</p>
<a name="changes-to-parsing-model"></a>
<h3><a href="#toc-entry-16">Changes to parsing model</a></h3>
<p>There have been some changes also to the parsing model:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The node representing the deprecated <code>[Return]</code> setting has been renamed from
<code>Return</code> to <code>ReturnSetting</code>. At the same time, the node representing the
<code>RETURN</code> statement has been renamed from <code>ReturnStatement</code> to <code>Return</code> (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4939">#4939</a>).</p>
<p>To ease transition, <code>ReturnSetting</code> has existed as an alias for <code>Return</code> starting
from Robot Framework 6.1 (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4656">#4656</a>) and <code>ReturnStatement</code> is preserved as an alias
now. In addition to that, the <code>ModelVisitor</code> base class has special handling for
<code>visit_ReturnSetting</code> and <code>visit_ReturnStatement</code> visitor methods so that they work
correctly with <code>ReturnSetting</code> and <code>ReturnStatement</code> with Robot Framework 6.1 and
newer. Issue <a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4939">#4939</a> explains this in more detail and has a concrete example
how to support also older Robot Framework versions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The node representing the <code>Test Tags</code> setting as well as the deprecated
<code>Force Tags</code> setting has been renamed from <code>ForceTags</code> to <code>TestTags</code> (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4385">#4385</a>).
<code>ModelVisitor</code> has special handling for the <code>visit_ForceTags</code> method so
that it will continue to work also after the change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The token type used with <code>AS</code> (or <code>WITH NAME</code>) in library imports has been changed
to <code>Token.AS</code> (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4375">#4375</a>). <code>Token.WITH_NAME</code> still exists as an alias for <code>Token.AS</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Statement <code>type</code> and <code>tokens</code> have been moved from <code>_fields</code> to <code>_attributes</code> (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4912">#4912</a>).
This may affect debugging the model.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<a name="changes-to-libdoc-spec-files"></a>
<h3><a href="#toc-entry-17">Changes to Libdoc spec files</a></h3>
<p>The following deprecated constructs have been removed from Libdoc spec files (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4667">#4667</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>datatypes</code> have been removed from XML or JSON spec files. They were deprecated in
favor of <code>typedocs</code> already in Robot Framework 5.0 (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4160">#4160</a>).</li>
<li>Type names are not anymore written to XML specs as content of the <code>&lt;type&gt;</code> elements.
The name is available as the <code>name</code> attribute of <code>&lt;type&gt;</code> elements since
Robot Framework 6.1 (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4538">#4538</a>).</li>
<li>
<code>types</code> and <code>typedocs</code> attributes have been removed from arguments in JSON specs.
The <code>type</code> attribute introduced in RF 6.1 (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4538">#4538</a>) needs to be used instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Libdoc schema files have been updated and can be found via
<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/tree/master/doc/schema/">https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/tree/master/doc/schema/</a>.</p>
<a name="changes-to-selecting-tests-with-suite-test-and-include"></a>
<h3><a href="#toc-entry-18">Changes to selecting tests with <code>--suite</code>, <code>--test</code> and <code>--include</code></a></h3>
<p>There are two changes related to selecting tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>When using <code>--test</code> and <code>--include</code> together, tests matching either of them
are selected (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4721">#4721</a>). Earlier tests need to match both options to be selected.</li>
<li>When selecting a suite using its parent suite as a prefix like <code>--suite parent.suite</code>,
the given name must match the full suite name (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4720">#4720</a>). Earlier it was enough if
the prefix matched the closest parent or parents.</li>
</ul>
<a name="other-backwards-incompatible-changes"></a>
<h3><a href="#toc-entry-19">Other backwards incompatible changes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The default value of the <code>stdin</code> argument used with <code>Process</code> library keyword
has been changed from <code>subprocess.PIPE</code> to <code>None</code> (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4103">#4103</a>). This change ought
to avoid processes hanging in some cases. Those who depend on the old behavior
need to use <code>stdin=PIPE</code> explicitly to enable that.</li>
<li>When type hints are specified as strings, they must use format <code>type</code>, <code>type[param]</code>,
<code>type[p1, p2]</code> or <code>t1 | t2</code> (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4711">#4711</a>). Using other formats will cause errors taking
keywords into use. In practice problems occur if the special characters <code>[</code>, <code>]</code>, <code>,</code>
and <code>|</code> occur in unexpected places. For example, <code>arg: "Hello, world!"</code> will cause
an error due to the comma.</li>
<li>
<code>datetime</code>, <code>date</code> and <code>timedelta</code> objects are sent over the Remote interface
differently than earlier (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4784">#4784</a>). They all used to be converted to strings, but
nowadays <code>datetime</code> is sent as-is, <code>date</code> is converted to <code>datetime</code> and sent like
that, and <code>timedelta</code> is converted to a <code>float</code> by using <code>timedelta.total_seconds()</code>.</li>
<li>Argument conversion support with <code>collections.abc.ByteString</code> has been removed (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4983">#4983</a>).
The reason is that <code>ByteString</code> is deprecated and will be removed in Python 3.14.
It has not been too often needed, but if you happen to use it, you can change
<code>arg:¬†ByteString</code> to <code>arg:¬†bytes¬†|¬†bytearray</code> and the functionality
stays exactly the same.</li>
<li>Paths passed to result file related listener version 3 methods like <code>output_file</code>
and <code>log_file</code> have been changed from strings to <code>pathlib.Path</code> objects (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4988">#4988</a>).
Most of the time both kinds of paths work interchangeably, so this change is unlikely
to cause issues. If you need to handle these paths as strings, they can be converted
by using <code>str(path)</code>.</li>
<li>
<code>robot.utils.normalize</code> does not anymore support bytes (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4936">#4936</a>).</li>
<li>Deprecated <code>accept_plain_values</code> argument has been removed from the
<code>timestr_to_secs</code> utility function (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4861">#4861</a>).</li>
</ul>
<a name="deprecations"></a>
<h2><a href="#toc-entry-20">Deprecations</a></h2>
<a name="return-setting"></a>
<h3><a href="#toc-entry-21"><code>[Return]</code> setting</a></h3>
<p>The <code>[Return]</code> setting for specifying the return value from user keywords has
been "loudly" deprecated (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4876">#4876</a>). It has been "silently" deprecated since
Robot Framework 5.0 when the much more versatile <code>RETURN</code> setting was introduced
(<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4078">#4078</a>), but now using it will cause a deprecation warning. The plan is to
preserve the <code>[Return]</code> setting at least until Robot Framework 8.0.</p>
<p>If you have lot of data that uses <code>[Return]</code>, the easiest way to update it is
using the <a href="https://robotidy.readthedocs.io">Robotidy</a> tool that can convert <code>[Return]</code> to <code>RETURN</code> automatically.
If you have data that is executed also with Robot Framework versions that do
not support <code>RETURN</code>, you can use the <code>Return From Keyword</code> keyword instead.
That keyword will eventually be deprecated and removed as well, though.</p>
<a name="singular-section-headers"></a>
<h3><a href="#toc-entry-22">Singular section headers</a></h3>
<p>Using singular section headers like <code>*** Test Case ***</code> or <code>*** Setting ***</code>
nowadays causes a deprecation warning (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4432">#4432</a>). They were silently deprecated
in Robot Framework 6.0 for reasons explained in issue <a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4431">#4431</a>.</p>
<a name="deprecated-attributes-in-parsing-running-and-result-models"></a>
<h3><a href="#toc-entry-23">Deprecated attributes in parsing, running and result models</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>In the parsing model, <code>For.variables</code>, <code>ForHeader.variables</code>, <code>Try.variable</code> and
<code>ExceptHeader.variable</code> attributes have been deprecated in favor of the new <code>assign</code>
attribute (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4708">#4708</a>).</li>
<li>In running and result models, <code>For.variables</code> and <code>TryBranch.variable</code> have been
deprecated in favor of the new <code>assign</code> attribute (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4708">#4708</a>).</li>
<li>In the result model, control structures like <code>FOR</code> were earlier modeled so that they
looked like keywords. Nowadays they are considered totally different objects and
their keyword specific attributes <code>name</code>, <code>kwnane</code>, <code>libname</code>, <code>doc</code>, <code>args</code>,
<code>assign</code>, <code>tags</code> and <code>timeout</code> have been deprecated  (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4846">#4846</a>).</li>
<li>
<code>starttime</code>, <code>endtime</code> and <code>elapsed</code> time attributes in the result model have been
silently deprecated (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4258">#4258</a>). Accessing them does not yet cause a deprecation
warning, but users are recommended to use <code>start_time</code>, <code>end_time</code> and
<code>elapsed_time</code> attributes that are available since Robot Framework 6.1.</li>
<li>
<code>kwname</code>, <code>libname</code> and <code>sourcename</code> attributes used by the <code>Keyword</code> object
in the result model have been silently deprecated (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4884">#4884</a>). New code should use
<code>name</code>, <code>owner</code> and <code>source_name</code> instead.</li>
</ul>
<a name="other-deprecated-features"></a>
<h3><a href="#toc-entry-24">Other deprecated features</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Using embedded arguments with a variable that has a value not matching custom
embedded argument patterns nowadays causes a deprecation warning (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4524">#4524</a>).
Earlier variables used as embedded arguments were always accepted without
validating values.</li>
<li>Using <code>FOR IN ZIP</code> loops with lists having different lengths without explicitly
using <code>mode=SHORTEST</code> has been deprecated (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4685">#4685</a>). The strict mode where lengths
must match will be the default mode in the future.</li>
<li>Various utility functions in the <code>robot.utils</code> package that are no longer used
by Robot Framework itself, including the whole Python 2/3 compatibility layer,
have been deprecated (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4501">#4501</a>). If you need some of these utils, you can copy
their code to your own tool or library. This change may affect existing
libraries and tools in the ecosystem.</li>
<li>
<code>case_insensitive</code> and <code>whitespace_insensitive</code> arguments used by some
Collections and String library keywords have been deprecated in favor of
<code>ignore_case</code> and <code>ignore_whitespace</code>. The new arguments were added for
consistency reasons (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4954">#4954</a>) and the old arguments will continue to work
for the time being.</li>
<li>Passing time as milliseconds to the <code>elapsed_time_to_string</code> utility function
has been deprecated (<a href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4862">#4862</a>).</li>
