* Description

  Helpful Ruby routines for parsing orgmode files. The most
  significant thing this library does today is convert orgmode files
  to textile. Currently, you cannot do much to customize the
  conversion. The supplied textile conversion is optimized for
  extracting "content" from the orgfile as opposed to "metadata."

* History

** 2014-02-08: Version 0.9.0

   - Let's make sure =#+INCLUDE:= is not supported

#+INCLUDE: "./README.txt" src text

   - And confirm that syntax highlight is supported

#+begin_src ruby
module GitHub
  module Markup
    VERSION = 'test'
    Version = VERSION
  end
end
#+end_src

** 2009-12-30: Version 0.5.1

   - Minor enhancement: Recognize lines starting with ":" as examples.
   - Minor enhancement: Recognize #+BEGIN_SRC as source blocks
   - Minor enhancement: Add "src" and "example" classes to <pre> blocks.


** 2009-12-30: Version 0.5.0

   - Parse (but not necessarily *use*) in-buffer settings. The following
     in-buffer settings *are* used:
     - Understand the #+TITLE: directive.
     - Exporting todo keywords (option todo:t)
     - Numbering headlines (option num:t)
     - Skipping text before the first headline (option skip:t)
     - Skipping tables (option |:nil)
     - Custom todo keywords
     - EXPORT_SELECT_TAGS and EXPORT_EXLUDE_TAGS for controlling parts of
       the tree to export
   - Rewrite "file:(blah).org" links to "http:(blah).html" links. This
     makes the inter-links to other org-mode files work.
   - Uses <th> tags inside table rows that precede table separators.
   - Bugfixes:
     - Headings now have HTML escaped.

** 2009-12-29: Version 0.4.2

   - Got rid of the extraneous newline at the start of code blocks.
   - Everything now shows up in code blocks, even org-mode metadata.
   - Fixed bugs:
     - Regressed smart double quotes with HTML escaping. Added a test
       case and fixed the regression.

** 2009-12-29: Version 0.4.1
   - HTML is now escaped by default
   - org-mode comments will show up in a code block.

** 2009-12-29: Version 0.4

   - The first thing output in HTML gets the class "title"
   - HTML output is now indented
   - Proper support for multi-paragraph list items.

     See? This paragraph is part of the last bullet.
     
   - Fixed bugs:
     - "rake spec" wouldn't work on Linux. Needed "require 'rubygems'".

** 2009-12-27: Version 0.3

   - Uses rubypants to get better typography (smart quotes, ellipses, etc...).
   - Fixed bugs:
     - Tables and lists did not get properly closed at the end of file
     - You couldn't do inline formatting inside table cells
     - Characters in PRE blocks were not HTML escaped.
   
** 2009-12-26: Version 0.2

   - Added =to_html= output on the parser.
   - Added support for the full range of inline markup: *bold*,
     /italic/, =code=, ~verbatim~, _underline_, +strikethrough+.
   - Lots of refactoring to make the code more maintainable.

** 2009-12-23: Version 0.1

   - Added support for block code, like this:

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     def flush!
     @logger.debug "FLUSH ==========> #{@output_type}"
     if (@output_type == :blank) then
       @output << "\n"
     elsif (@buffer.length > 0) then
       if @cancel_modifier then
         @output << "p. " if @output_type == :paragraph
         @cancel_modifier = false
       end
       @output << @paragraph_modifier if (@paragraph_modifier and not sticky_modifier?)
       @output << @buffer.textile_substitution << "\n"
     end
     @buffer = ""
   end
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   - Major code cleanup: Created the =OutputBuffer= class that
     greatly simplified a lot of the messiness of =textile=
     conversion.
   - Added support for line breaks within list items.
