Zerodoc
=======

Version 0.2.0 Last updated 2014-08-17 pablo@odkq.com

Zerodoc is a "plain text format" in the spirit of `asciidoc`, `POD`,
`reStructuredText` or `markdown`, with an emphasis on simplicity and
extensibility. Very few formatting options are avaliable, both to
keep the parser simple and to make it easy to write new generators
for the whole format.

Included are a Python library can be used to translate an input
file or buffer into a tree that for wich generators can be easily
written, and a command line tool to call existing generators for
HTML, reStructuredText (that can then be converted or integrated
with other tools like Sphinx) and a JSON intermediate representation.

1. THE ZERODOC FORMAT

1.1 PARAGRAPHS AND LINES

Zerodoc files are simple text files organized in paragraphs. A
paragraph is a group of text lines separated from other paragraphs
by blank lines. Lists and source code copied *verbatim* can be
defined. An unintrusive format for links is used, based on
a references system.

Lines are limited to 72 characters for regular (not code 
or diagrams) text. If you need to put something more into a line
(for example, a long URL), divide it in two and put a backslash (\)
with no spaces at the end.

Example:

 This is a very long url that needs to be splitted in three:
 http://www.reallyreallyreallylonguniformresourcelocatorredir\
 ection.com/redirectionator.php?theredirectioncode=d72a565ab8\
 7dedf7b5fa84b3ec4b9f11

Renders into:

This is a very long url that needs to be splitted in three:
http://www.reallyreallyreallylonguniformresourcelocatorredir\
ection.com/redirectionator.php?theredirectioncode=d72a565ab8\
7dedf7b5fa84b3ec4b9f11

1.2 LISTS

Lists are defined as paragrahps prefixed with a dash, and can be
nested. Example

 - The first element in a list
  - A nested element into the first consisting of two lines
    that are joined on output
  - Another nested element
 - The third element in a list

Renders into:

- The first element in a list
 - A nested element into the first consisting of two lines
   that are joined on output
 - Another nested element
- The third element in a list

Backslash joining also occur inside list elements:

 - The first element in a list. as it have two lines
   with no backslash, an space is inserted between 'lines' and 'with'
 - To join the two lines without adding a space a back\
   slash is used. Note that the two spaces formatting the listline are
   removed

renders into:

- The first element in a list. as it have two lines
  with no backslash, an space is inserted between 'lines' and 'with'
- To join the two lines without adding a space a back\
  slash is used. Note that the two spaces formatting the listline are
  removed after the backslash

NOTE: There are no numbered lists. In the "phylosophy" of zerodoc,
numbers can not be omited from the original text nor 'computed'
because that will make the text less readable than it's processed
output.

1.3 FORMATTING ATTRIBUTES

Some attributes for the text inherited from other common formats and
email conventions are supported:

 - This is an *emphasis*
 - This is an _underline_ (cursive on certain displays or formats,
   as in manual pages)
 - This is a 'cursive'

Renders into:

- This is an *emphasis*
- This is an _underline_ (cursive on certain displays or formats,
  as in manual pages)
- This is a 'cursive'

1.4 LINKS

Links can be included directly in the text along with their destination,
or referenced first in the text and then 'resolved' in another line.

Source of a link:

 This `link`:http://www.google.com will redirect to google

Will render as:

This `link`:http://www.google.com will redirect to google

Referenced links are 'resolved' in lists of links. This lists of links
will be removed from output directly. If the list is contained in a
section alone, the section is also removed from output. See the
'References' section at the end of the source code of this document
for an example. An 'autocontained' example could be:

 This line contains two referenced links: `firstlink` and `secondlink`

 - `firstlink`:http://www.google.com
 - `secondlink`:http://www.google.com

Wich renders into:

This line contains two referenced links: `firstlink` and `secondlink`

- `firstlink`:http://www.google.com
- `secondlink`:http://www.google.com

1.5 SOURCE CODE

Source code is text that will be included verbatim in the output. In
source code, newlines are meaningful and no limits on line-length are
imposed. An example:

 #include <stdio.h>

 int main() {
         // print hello world 100 times
         for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
                 printf("Hello, world!\n");
         }
 }

Source code is identified by one space before the content of
the first line and one or more spaces in the rest. No tabs can
be used, so either transform tabs-only source code before pasting
or use a tool like expand(1) to do it for you. Blank lines are also
included verbatim, up to the one delimiting the next 'regular'
paragraph (one that contains text and starts on the first column)

To illustrate source code, i am going to paste the source code (yo
dawg) of the example above, along with the regular paragraph-lines
sorrounding it:

 source code, newlines are meaningful and no limits on line-length are
 imposed. An example:
 
  #include <stdio.h>
 
  int main() {
          // print hello world 100 times
          for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
                  printf("Hello, world!\n");
          }
  }
 
 Source code is identified by one space before the content of
 the first line and one or more spaces in the rest. No tabs can

 When pygmentize is used, the default language for syntax highlighting
 can be specified in options.

1.6 DIAGRAMS AND IMAGES

Diagrams can be either included directly in the output, just as
source code, or optionally converted to images (when this is
possible, for example in a manual page it does not make sense to
include images). Diagrams are converted using ditaa, aafigure,
ascii2svg or tikz depending on the options parsed to the renderer.
Refer to the `aafigure manual page` or to the `ditaa website` for
help on this formats.

Diagrams are recognized by using TWO or more spaces before the
first line of them. Anything up to the next 'regular' paragraph
is considered part of the diagram.

Source-code paragraphs and diagrams can not be adjacent; they need
a 'regular' text paragraph (starting on the first column) between
them. This makes sense since no diagram can follow source code or
viceversa without at least an introduction of what the reader is
seeing.

1.6.1 ASCIITOSVG ASCII-ART DIAGRAMS

The default for ascii art diagrams is `asciitosvg`. As it name implies,
it converts text to SVG wich is quite convenient. It is written in php.
Example diagram: (asciitosvg)

  This is an asciitosvg diagram

  .-------------------------.
  |[Logo]                   |
  | .---.-. .-----. .-----. |
  | | .-. | +-->  | |  <--| |
  | | '-' | |  <--| +-->  | |
  | '---'-' '-----' '-----' |
  |  ascii     2      svg   |
  |                         |
  '-------------------------'
   https://9vx.org/~dho/a2s/
  [Logo]: {"fill":"#88d","a2s:delref":true}

1.6.2 AAFIGURE ASCII-ART DIAGRAMS

Another format to convert ascii art diagrams to graphics is aafigure. it
is written in Python and have quite convenient idioms for things like
sequence diagrams:

  Example diagram: (aafigure)

  +---------+  +---------+  +---------+
  |Object 1 |  |Object 2 |  |Object 3 |
  +----+----+  +----+----+  +----+----+
       |            |            |
       |            |            |
       X  Example   |            |
       X----------->X            |
       X            X            |
       X<-----------X            |
       X            |            |
       X  Example   |            |
       X------------------------>X
       |            |            X
       X----------->X            X---+
       X            X            X   |
       |            |            X<--+
       X<------------------------X
       X            |            |
       |            |            |
       |            |            |

1.6.3 DITAA ASCII-ART DIAGRAMS

Another common format for ascii art diagrams is ditaa. It does not
support svg output.

 This is the source code of the following paragraph
 (diagram taken from the `ditaa website`:
 
 Example diagram: (ditaa)

 +--------+   +-------+    +-------+
 |        | --+ ditaa +--> |       |
 |  Text  |   +-------+    |diagram|
 |Document|   |!magic!|    |       |
 |     {d}|   |       |    |       |
 +---+----+   +-------+    +-------+
      :                         ^
      |       Lots of work      |
      +-------------------------+

This is the source code of the following paragraph
(diagram taken from the `ditaa website`:

  Example diagram: (ditaa)

  +--------+   +-------+    +-------+
  |        | --+ ditaa +--> |       |
  |  Text  |   +-------+    |diagram|
  |Document|   |!magic!|    |       |
  |     {d}|   |       |    |       |
  +---+----+   +-------+    +-------+
       :                         ^
       |       Lots of work      |
       +-------------------------+

Note that there are two spaces before the first +---

1.6.4 TIKZ DIAGRAMS

A Tikz diagram (from the Tikz examples)

LaTeX source code for that Tikz chunk:

 \begin{tikzpicture}[auto,node distance=3cm,
   thick,main node/.style={circle,fill=blue!20,draw,
   font=\sffamily\Large\bfseries}]
 
   \node[main node] (1) {1};
   \node[main node] (2) [below left of=1] {2};
   \node[main node] (3) [below right of=2] {3};
   \node[main node] (4) [below right of=1] {4};
 
   \path[every node/.style={font=\sffamily\small}]
     (1) edge node [left] {0.6} (4)
         edge [bend right] node[left] {0.3} (2)
         edge [loop above] node {0.1} (1)
     (2) edge node [right] {0.4} (1)
         edge node {0.3} (4)
         edge [loop left] node {0.4} (2)
         edge [bend right] node[left] {0.1} (3)
     (3) edge node [right] {0.8} (2)
         edge [bend right] node[right] {0.2} (4)
     (4) edge node [left] {0.2} (3)
         edge [loop right] node {0.6} (4)
         edge [bend right] node[right] {0.2} (1);
 \end{tikzpicture}

1.6.6 Diagram tagging and autodetection

As with source code, the type of diagram is autodetected for Tikz and
gnuplot diagrams. This detection can be overriden by specifing it in
the first line of the diagram, between parenthesis.

1.7 DEFINITION LISTS

A definition list is a list of terms and corresponding definitions.
It usually renders (in HTML, man pages, ReST) in the text of the
definition indented with respect to the title. It is useful for
documenting functions and command line parameters.

Following is an example:

 man ls
     Display the manual page for the item (program) ls.
 man -a intro
     Display,  in  succession, all of the available intro manual
     pages contained within the manual.  It is possible
     to quit between successive displays or skip any of them.

that renders into:

man ls
    Display the manual page for the item (program) ls.

man -a intro
    Display,  in  succession, all of the available intro manual
    pages contained within the manual.  It is possible
    to quit between successive displays or skip any of them.

1.8 THE DEFAULT ZERODOC STRUCTURE

1.8.1 HEADER

The header in a zerodoc document contains the title, an optional
abstract and a table of contents. The table of contents needs to
be updated by hand (this is different from other well known text
formats but allow zerodoc to have free-form titles (no --- nor
~~~ nor any other form of markup is needed):

 This is the title, that can spawn several
 lines

 This are one or several paragraphs of abstract

 1. Title 1
 2. Title 2

1.8.1.1 TITLE

The title can spawn several lines (a whole paragraph) that will be
joined together on output

The table of contents can be prefixed by a 'Table of conents' line
that will be recognized automatically as the TOC title. If that line
is not present, it will also be ommited on the transformed output.

1.8.1.2 ABSTRACT

The abstract is a group of paragraphs that appear before the Table
of content.

1.8.1.3 TABLE OF CONTENTS

The table of contents is a list of the titles of the different
sections, for example

 - 1. Section one
 - 2. Section two
 - 3. Third section

Will define the table of contents of a document, if found in the
header (after the abstract). If a title listed here is not found
in the document, an error is yielded.

1.8.2 BODY

The body is formed by several paragraphs. Paragraphs are divided
into sections by lines with titles. The lines with titles should
appear in the TOC and should have the same content as the TOC.
Optionally they can be in uppercase for clarity. As the transformed
document usually will have better ways to emphasize the title, 
the lowercase format used in the TOC will be used regardless of
uppercase being used. For example, the next section of this document
starts with

 2. INSTALLING ZERODOC

 2.1 Prerrequisites

And in the TOC the pertinent lines appear as:

 -- toc fragment --
   - 1.7.1.3 Table of contents
  - 1.7.2 Body
 - 2. Installing zerodoc
  - 2.1 Prerrequisites

As you can see on the start of the next section, the title appears
in lowercase (as in the TOC above)

2. INSTALLING ZERODOC

2.1 PRERREQUISITES

Zerodoc needs Python (2.6 or newer) the Python PLY 'lex and yacc'
utilities (2.5 or newer) and distutils for installation. Aditionally
when generating diagrams, the programs to parse them need to be
installed as well.

As an example, in a GNU/Linux Debian 6.0 'Squeeze' system, the
requirements can be installed using:

 # apt-get install python-ply python-aafigure ditaa

To generate diagrams with gnuplot or tikz, install the pertinent
packages

 # apt-get install gnuplot

 # apt-get install texlive-picture

2.2 INSTALLING THE LIBRARY AND INTERPRETER

2.2.1 USING A GIT SNAPSHOT

Clone the github repository using

 $ git clone git://github.com/odkq/zerodoc.git

Change to the zerodoc dir and call setup.py as root

 $ cd zerodoc/
 $ sudo ./setup.py install

2.2.2 USING PYPI

3. USING THE COMMAND LINE CONVERTER

zerodoc - converts a zerodoc text file to HTML and many
other formats

3.1 SYNOPSIS

Usage: zerodoc [options]

Options:

-h, --help
    show this help message and exit

-f FORMAT, --format=FORMAT
    Output format. If ommited, 'html'

-o OPTIONS, --options=OPTIONS
    Options for format renderer

-i FILE, --input=FILE
    Use <filename> as input file. If ommited, use
    stdin.

-O FILE, --output=FILE
    Use <filename> as output file. If ommited,use
    stdout.

3.2 HTML OUTPUT OPTIONS

ditaa
    Use ditaa to format diagrams. When this option
    is used, you can specify the path of the ditaa
    .jar file with jarpath:<path>. If jarpath is
    ommited, 'ditta' will be called (you can install
    a command-line ditta wraper in Debian and others
    with apt-get install ditaa)

jarpath:<path>
    Location of the .jar path (there is no default,
    'java' must be in the $PATH)

aafigure
   Use aafigure to format diagrams

svg
   Prefer svg in output when applicable (when the 
   converter outputs it and when the rendered format allows
   for scalable graphics)

datauri
   Do not generate image files, embbed the images
   directly in the HTML using `DataURIscheme`

3.3 reStructuredText output options

notoc
    Usually `reStructuredText` processors attach their own index in the
    side (`sphinx-doc`, for example). In that case, you better do not
    output the toc (it is still used to get section titles)

3.4 JSON OUTPUT OPTIONS

Json output has no options. It's output is the json render of the
parsed tree with no interpretation whatsoever

3.5 CONFLUENCE OUTPUT OPTIONS

ditaa, jarpath, aafigure, datauri
    With the same meaning as in the HTML output options

You can specify an output file, and paste it by hand into
the confluence 'edition' formulary, or you can make zerodoc client
upload it directly with this options:

folder:<folder>
    Folder (path) for the uploaded document

user:<user>
    User to use

passwd:<passd>
    Password

host:<host>
    Host
