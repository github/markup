                  =  Introduction  =

Welcome to the txt2tags sample file.

Here you have examples and a brief explanation of all
marks.

The first 3 lines of the this file are used as headers,
on the following format:
```
line1: document title
line2: author name, email
line3: date, version
```

Lines with balanced equal signs = around are titles.

              =  Fonts and Beautifiers  =

We have two sets of fonts:

The NORMAL type that can be improved with beautifiers.

The TYPEWRITER type that uses monospaced font for
pre-formatted text.

We will now enter on a subtitle...


                  ==  Beautifiers  ==

The text marks for beautifiers are simple, just as you
type on a plain text email message.

We use double *, /, - and _ to represent **bold**,
//italic//, --strike-- and __underline__.

The **//bold italic//** style is also supported as a
combination.


              ==  Pre-Formatted Text  ==

We can put a code sample or other pre-formatted text:
```
  here    is     pre-formatted
//marks// are  **not**  ``interpreted``
```

And also, it's easy to put a one line pre-formatted
text:
``` prompt$ ls /etc

Or use ``pre-formatted`` inside sentences.


                ==  More Cosmetics  ==

Special entities like email (duh@somewhere.com) and
URL (http://www.duh.com) are detected automagically,
as long as the horizontal line:

--------------------------------------------------------
^ thin or large v
========================================================

You can also specify an [explicit link http://duh.org]
or an [explicit email duh@somewhere.com] with label.

And remember,
	A TAB in front of the line does a quotation.
		More TABs, more depth (if allowed).
Nice.


                      =  Lists  =

A list of items is natural, just putting a **dash** or
a **plus** at the beginning of the line.


                  ==  Plain List  ==

The dash is the default list identifier. For sublists,
just add **spaces** at the beginning of the line. More
spaces, more sublists.

- Earth
  - America
    - South America
      - Brazil
        - How deep can I go?
  - Europe
    - Lots of countries
- Mars
  - Who knows?


The list ends with **two** consecutive blank lines.


                 ==  Numbered List  ==

The same rules as the plain list, just a different
identifier (plus).

+ one
+ two
+ three
  - mixed lists!
  - what a mess
    + counting again
    + ...
+ four


                ==  Definition List  ==

The definition list identifier is a colon, followed by
the term. The term contents is placed on the next line.

: orange
  a yellow fruit
: apple
  a green or red fruit
: other fruits
  - wee!
  - mixing lists
    + again!
    + and again!


                     =  Tables  =

Use pipes to compose table rows and cells.
Double pipe at the line beginning starts a heading row.
Natural spaces specify each cell alignment.

 || heading 1 |  heading 2  |  heading 3 |
  | cell 1.1  |  cell 1.2   |   cell 1.3 |
  | cell 2.1  |  cell 2.2   |   cell 2.3 |

Without the last pipe, no border:

 || heading 1 |  heading 2  |  heading 3
  | cell 1.1  |  cell 1.2   |   cell 1.3
  | cell 2.1  |  cell 2.2   |   cell 2.3


                =  Special Entities  =

Because things were too simple.


                    ==  Images  ==

The image mark is as simple as it can be: ``[filename]``.

                      [img/photo.jpg]  

- The filename must end in PNG, JPG, GIF, or similar.
- No spaces inside the brackets!


                     ==  Other  ==

The handy ``%%date`` macro expands to the current date.

So today is %%date on the ISO ``YYYYMMDD`` format.

You can also specify the date format with the %? flags,
as ``%%date(%m-%d-%Y)`` which gives: %%date(%m-%d-%Y).

That's all for now.
